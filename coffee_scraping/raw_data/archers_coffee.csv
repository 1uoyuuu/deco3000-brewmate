Ethiopia - Alo Village Archers Lot Natural,"strawberry, honeydew, peach, sugarcane",145.00,"Description Description Producer: Tamiru Tadesse / Alo CoffeeLocation: Alo Village, Bensa, SidamaVariety: 74158Process: Natural Anaerobic 48 HoursAltitude: 2,450 maslCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Only a year into establishing Alo Coffee Export Plc, Tamiru Tadesse had already managed to foster a commendable reputation among specialty coffee connoisseurs around the world, with a burgeoning client base across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In 2021 Tamiru won 1st Place at the Ethiopia Cup of Excellence & advanced closer toward his goal of bringing greater recognition and rewards to Sidama Bensa coffee farmers, whose hard work and dedication make top-quality coffees possible. Six years working in coffee, Sidama Bensa-born Tamiru saw the great disconnect between the exceptional flavors and high cup quality potential of his hometown's coffees and the way these were being undervalued across the market. It was also too clear to him how this put the smallholder coffee-growing families and the country's coffee industry at a huge disadvantage. A friend of Tamiru winning the 2020 Ethiopia Cup of Excellence inspired him to personally contribute to a solution by starting his company, Alo Coffee. Through Alo Coffee, he is able to provide the means for smallholders to process their laboriously cultivated, inherently organic, and flavor-rich coffee cherries into distinctive lots of the highest quality, and then match them with the specialty coffee communities that recognize their value and properly reward it. Alo Village is the site of the company’s processing headquarters where the coffee growers in the vicinity bring their coffee cherries for post-harvest processing. It is situated at remarkably high elevations from 2,400 masl. Like the rest of the smallholder farmers in the country, the inhabitants of Alo Village rely on the farmlands granted to their families by the government for income mostly from coffee and food mostly comprising false banana and maize. Since each parcel covers about 1 – 2 hectares at most, coffee yields by household are constrained and volumes do not reach marketable levels, until they are aggregated by producers like Alo Coffee. On their own, each family and the community do not have the most current knowhow and sufficient resources to increase their farms’ productivity, nor to maintain and enhance the quality of the soils as well as that of their coffee cherries post-harvest. The involvement of quality-oriented and eco-socially committed specialty coffee producers like Alo Coffee contributes to alleviating the livelihood of the coffee-farming families, such as in Alo Village. To immediately benefit the smallholder coffee growers, Alo Coffee purchases their coffee cherries at a significant premium that provides a decent income to cover household essentials and their children’s education-related expenses. With a view for the longer term, Alo Coffee also provides direct assistance to the smallholder farmers through knowledge-sharing around better practices in agronomy, cultivation, farm maintenance, and harvesting, while initiating and funding community development projects such as building schools in the communities within their scope. Further, by overseeing the end-to-end conduct of post-harvest processing, Alo Coffee unburdens the smallholders of the related risks and costs, enabling them to focus their attention and energy on maintaining the natural, unblemished condition of the land and looking after their coffee trees to ensure they flourish. By association with Tamiru and Alo Coffee, coffee-growing communities like Alo Village also have a better chance of their concerns and interests being acknowledged, advanced, and addressed by influential stakeholders across the industry. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process ‘Ethiopian heirloom’ is the general term commonly used to identify coffee originating from Ethiopia. It covers two classifications: Jimma Agricultural Research Center (JARC) varieties and regional landrace varieties. JARC varieties were developed and released to improve the productivity and livelihood of smallholder coffee farmers, to boost the country's coffee industry. These varieties are promoted and bred because of their good quality (when grown at the recommended elevations), resistance to or tolerance of adverse elements, and adaptability to diverse environmental conditions. There are 40+ JARC varieties comprised mostly of pure line selections and a handful of hybrids. Regional landraces, meanwhile, are varieties that propagate in the wild, without regulated interventions. Sidama Bensa-grown 74158, a JARC variety generally observed to express Geisha-esque floral, citrus, and honeyed notes, has consistently ranked among the best at the Ethiopia Cup of Excellence and fetched the highest prices at the auction. The Archers Lot Archers Lots culminate our co-founders’ creativity and technical acumen to compose truly artisanal specialty coffee experiences for both the discerning and adventurous specialty coffee connoisseurs, in collaboration with our closest producing partners. In this Archers-curated 48-hour natural anaerobic process, Alo Village smallholder farmers brought the perfectly ripe, hand-harvested, and carefully pre-cleaned cherries to the Alo Washing Station, where they were screened at the door and then sorted again to ensure uniformity of the ripeness level (visually indicated by color) before being placed in 50-60 KG plastic barrels and then sealed with lids having a one-way valve — to aid in maintaining an oxygen-free fermentation phase throughout the pre-determined 48-hour period. After this, the barrels were emptied onto the raised beds, as the whole cherries were evenly spread out in very thin layers, allowing the fermentation juices to sufficiently drain from them. The specific instruction to maintain very thinly layered cherries throughout the sun-drying phase was deliberate, to avoid extraneous microbial activity as the coffees had already undergone the necessary fermentation in the barrels prior. The target moisture level was achieved after 18 to 21 days. As a result of this process, this cup expresses intricate multilayered acidities and subtle floral undertones, balanced by the refreshing and clean sweetness of sugarcane, accompanied by a silky mouthfeel.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-alo-village-archers-lot-natural
Colombia - El Vergel Geisha Clouds,"lavender, clementine, red apple, berries",125.00,"Description Description Producer: Elias & Shady Bayter / Milton MonroyLocation: San Cayetano, Tolima Variety: GeishaProcess: Natural AnaerobicAltitude: 1800 MASLCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Brothers Elias and Shady Bayter implement coffee development projects focused on empowering smallholder farmers in their home department, Tolima, with updated knowledge to diversify the flavor profiles their coffees can offer. This leads to an increase in their crops' quality and market value. They also proactively connect with international specialty coffee roasters to match their own and their partners' coffees with the appropriate consumers. Through these connections, they enable the two ends of the coffee value chain to get the fullest benefit. Milton Monroy of Finca San Cayetano is one of Elias and Shady’s partners. His farm is reputed for its cultivation practices and is one of the most well-known in the San Juan de la China area. He started his coffee journey with his father and honed his coffee knowledge by working with common varieties like Caturra and Castillo for several years. They later heard of Geisha and, after cupping the variety for the first time, decided to dedicate 25% of their land to it. He considers this the best decision they have made and has not ceased in efforts to elevate the quality of the Geisha their farm produces. He has mastered this craft to the extent that they have made the ranks of COE in Colombia, and during the last Ibague Cafe Festival in November 2022, his Geisha micro-lot qualified him as one of the ten top producers in Tolima. The Exporter Forest Coffee is a platform established by Elias and Shady Bayter for their local farming communities to share best practices, and for their coffee to gain world recognition and better benefit from the international market. They celebrate the time-honored Colombian tradition of producing high-quality coffee by fusing legacy knowledge with innovative techniques. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Geisha is the storied variety acclaimed for its delicate complexity and clarity of fruit and floral flavors. For this reason, it is frequently showcased by coffee champions in their competition routines. To amplify its floral and fruit qualities, Milton and the Bayter brothers tailored the natural anaerobic processing method for this micro-lot. The selectively handpicked cherries were placed in sealed tanks in batches of 60 KG, and fermentation was made to last for 84 hours. Their team followed strict protocol that included moving the cherries every 12 hours to encourage even fermentation. The fine-tuned drying phase involved multiple stages. After draining the cherries for six hours, they were prudently passed through mechanical dryers —to evaporate the outermost layer of moisture and remove the risk of off-flavors. Then, the cherries were laid out on a specific raised bed for 24-32 days maximum, where the average temperature was optimal at 18° to 31°C. This was followed by a five-day interval in a dark room before the final drying stage. In that final stage, the coffee was placed in a custom-built silo with a 125 KG capacity, which the Bayter brothers and Milton calculated would achieve the proper moisture level and preserve the prized virtues of their Geisha — pronounced florals in balance with a complex acidity and unobtrusive sweetness.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/colombia-el-vergel-geisha-clouds
"Panama - Geisha M88, Abu Coffee","lavender, mango, strawberry, peach",270.00,"Description Description Producer: Jose LutrellLocation: Cañas Verdes, BoqueteVariety: GeishaProcess: Natural AnaerobicAltitude: 1,550 maslCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Jose Luttrell is the founder of Abu Coffee. He was already successful as an engineer, usually in the city and traveling overseas for work, when his father took him to revisit their family's farmlands in Boquete. This sparked his interest in specialty coffee which, in time, grew into a passion. It was after his father passed away that Jose took a deep dive into producing specialty coffee and when Abu Coffee was established. Abu (short for abuelo) was the affectionate nickname Jose's children had for their grandfather. By producing distinct and excellent coffees that could not have been grown elsewhere, and sharing them with the world, they keep his memory, and his love for coffee and Boquete alive, Abu Coffee started to become known when they won 6th place in the Geisha Washed category at the 2017 Best of Panama Competition. Their Geishas have been winning yearly at the BoP from then on. In 2021, Catuai lots they produced were also awarded in the Varietal Natural and Varietal Washed categories. These consecutive BoP wins are recognized as a particularly noteworthy achievement because Abu Coffee has been in operation for less than a decade, and is much younger than most of the producers in Panama's premier coffee-growing zone. Abu Coffee is situated in Cañas Verdes, Boquete, which benefits from a tropical forest microclimate. The coffee trees are cultivated at an average elevation of 1,550 MASL on the inclines of the Volcán Barú National Park, where the rich biodiversity is well-protected. Soils are fertile, deep, well-draining, and of volcanic origin. There is a good balance of shade from native trees, and sunlight due to the estate's location. There is also the right amount of moisture from a light tropical mist in the daytime and denser fog at dusk. These conditions help the cherries' maturation process, such that sugars intensify and enrich the beans' flavor. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The legendary Panama Geisha variety is acclaimed for its sweet florality and bright overtones. Since its debut win at the Best of Panama auction in 2004, it has kept specialty coffee lovers everywhere captivated by its delicacy, complexity, and clarity of flavors. As such, it is often showcased on coffee competition stages by a great number of coffee champions, and it also continues to fetch the highest prices. The esteemed status of the Panama Geisha is also due to its scarcity, owing to the variety’s unique genetics (responsible for its exceptional cup quality) that allows it to capture the best features of the Boquete terroir, and that are not shared by Geisha grown in other origins. The plants also require longer time to grow and more diligent care due to their delicate root systems. And, since Geisha trees have wide branch spans, they need to be spaced farther apart in the farm, resulting in less cherries per hectare at harvest. At the Abu Coffee farm in Canas Verdes, ripening takes nine to ten months, and two to three months to complete the harvesting process — all by hand-collection. Further, because the trees are very tall, hand-collecting the perfectly ripe cherries requires even the most seasoned pickers to exert more effort. For Lot M-88, the cherries were carefully hand-picked at the peak of maturation, and then hand-sorted and floated in mountain spring water. An anaerobic dry fermentation process in sealed plastic tanks with thick walls was done for 144 hours under the shade, which was followed by sun-drying the cherries on raised beds for 25 days.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/panama-geisha-m88-abu-coffee
"Panama - Nirvana, Finca Deborah","mangosteen, peach, raspberry, wine gums, sweet orange",365.00,"Description Description Producer: Jamison Savage / Finca Deborah Location: Volcan, Chiriqui, PanamaVariety: Green Tip GeishaProcess: Nitrogen-Macerated, Natural AnaerobicAltitude: 1700-1900 MASLCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Jamison Savage of Finca Deborah, Iris Estate, and Savage Coffees is known throughout the specialty coffee world due to his pioneering methods. Engaged in progressive processing techniques and farming practices respectful of nature, Jamison lets the most favorable, naturally occurring sensory nuances of a coffee shine on the palate. It’s a feat accomplished by few and evidently appreciated worldwide, as national and world coffee competitors frequently choose to showcase his coffees. 2016 saw Finca Deborah in the limelight when Taiwan’s Berg Wu won the World Barista Championship using a Geisha from the estate. Since then, numerous national champions have entrusted Jamison to design coffees for their routines on the world stage. Among them are our very own WBrC representative David Disuanco and France's Charity Cheung. The Finca Deborah story started long before 2016 and far away from Panama though. It was in the early 2000s when Jamison, at the height of his finance career in the US, decided a change was in order. He longed for a freer lifestyle to give himself and his family a chance to spend more time outdoors and to travel. At the same time, he was looking for a real estate asset to fill a gap in his investment portfolio. In our 2022 Producer’s Talk, Jamison shared that they were choosing between Panama and New Zealand. Panama eventually won out for practical reasons and the sheer beauty and promise of the land. Their deliberation and preparation took about five years and culminated in 2008, the year the Savage family uprooted and started anew on foreign soil. They made their new home in the Volcan region of the Chiriqui province, the seat of Panama Geisha cultivation and home to Finca Deborah, Iris Estate, and Savage Coffees. Finca Deborah is Jamison Savage’s foremost terroir-cognizant coffee plantation at 1,700 to 1,900 masl in Volcan, Chiriqui. The farm, which rests beneath a rainforest canopy, is organically cultivated and entirely solar-powered. In those pristine surroundings, the elegant Panama Geisha trees flourish, so cherries simply take in and contain the innate lushness and vibrance of the environment. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Nirvana started with harvesting perfectly ripe Green Tip Geisha cherries registering 21-24 on the BRIX meter. These cherries were twice sorted and selected before being deposited into hermetically sealed, stainless steel tanks. Throughout this fermentation phase, which played out in excess of 50 hours, the cherries were periodically flushed with nitrogen. Flushing the tanks with nitrogen evacuated any residual oxygen and created an anaerobic environment that allowed an extended duration of desired microbial activity among the cherries, intended to amplify only their desirable flavors. Throughout the extended fermentation phase, the cherries were constantly monitored and cataloged for both PH and temperature levels. The Finca Deborah team complied with strict parameters to ensure the process would only preserve and enhance the meticulously cultivated and harvested Panama Geisha's inherent sensory characteristics, and in no way allow them to acquire any unwanted notes or ""off"" flavors. After the required time inside the nitrogen-flushed tanks, the cherries were removed and transferred onto shaded, three-tiered raised African beds that Jamison himself designed. Temperatures and humidity were controlled inside the shaded drying areas, also referred to as dry houses, where these metrics were carefully maintained within specific parameters. The cherries were also consistently shifted throughout the day for even drying, to prevent undesired microbial activity from occurring, and to promote the development only of desired flavors. The cherries spent around 20 days on the drying beds before reaching the proper moisture level of approximately 11%. To protect the quality that had painstakingly been created, they were then bagged in Grain-pro and stored under optimal conditions of cool and stable temperatures for a reposo or seasoning process critical in Jamison's stringent end-to-end QC protocol. In reposo, the coffee's moisture content stabilized while allowing it to keep absorbing more flavor from its parchment or shell, before being hulled and further sorted by size, density, and color, and finally shipped to us. About the Panama Geisha Panama Geisha, of which Green Tip Geisha is one variation, is a rare, delicate, and complex variety well-loved for its sweet florality and citrus highlights. Since its debut win at the Best of Panama auction in 2004, it has kept specialty coffee lovers everywhere captivated by its endless possibilities, delicacy, complexity, and clarity of flavors. As such, it is often showcased on coffee competition stages by a great number of coffee champions, and it also continues to fetch the highest prices. While a coffee’s truest intrinsic qualities are still largely believed to be showcased best by traditional washed processing due to the demucilaging, washing, and scrubbing steps removing all traces of fruit from the bean, the expertise of seasoned and passionate producers like Jamison Savage allows them to direct the flavor character of the Panama Geisha towards a seemingly endless diversity of delightfully surprising trajectories. They do this through the purposeful implementation of traditional methods like the natural and honey processes, as well as intentional and innovative processing styles, such as this Nitrogen-Macerated, Natural Anaerobic process, which add to the complexity of the cup’s character — for example more layers of flavor or better mouthfeel — without compromising its inherent qualities from terroir and variety.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/panama-nirvana
"Colombia - Caturra Chiroso, Finca El Paraiso","sweet spices, star anise, clove, lavender, black liqourice",215.00,"Description Description Producer: Diego Samuel BermudezLocation: Piendamo, CaucaVariety: Caturra, ChirosoProcess: Thermal Shock WashedAltitude: 1,960 maslCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Finca El Paraiso is the realization of one family’s dream of a coffee farm as a kind of paradise. It started to materialize in 2008 when Diego Samuel Bermudez and his family began to cultivate an assortment of traditional, novel, and exotic coffee varieties across the well-endowed and sky-reaching terrains of Vereda Los Arados, Tunía in the Piendamó municipality of the Cauca department in Colombia. It is their family’s flagship farm, spanning 49 hectares, and the headquarters of their trailblazing post-harvest processing company, INDESTEC S.A.S, shorthand for “Innovation and Technological Development for Agriculture.” This is their platform for ongoing research into and the promotion of precise and purposeful experimental methods and techniques, like the stirringly named “Thermal Shock,” intended to create a cornucopia of peerless cup profiles. Their aim — to distinguish Finca El Paraiso among the department and the nation’s accomplished and prolific producers, generate greater interest across global specialty coffee lovers, elevate the value of Cauca-grown coffees, and on the whole, contribute to continuously raising the profile and position of Colombia as an innovative and pre-eminent origin of higher-end specialty coffees. Finca El Paraiso’s location on the Pan-American route between Popayán, Cauca’s capital, and Cali, a municipality in the neighboring department Valle del Cauca, with a prevailing climate described as temperate-humid and the frequent incidence of winds from the Pacific, has been attributed for the tropical notes frequently perceived in their coffees. Meanwhile, Cauca is one of the 21 officially designated coffee-growing departments of Colombia, which was granted its “Denomination of Origin” in 2011 as a testament to the remarkable quality and distinct flavor identity of its coffees. Due to Colombia’s immense heterogeneity of microclimates, terroirs, varieties, and their resultant flavor characters, Colombia is regarded in the world of coffee as a “Land of Diversity.” When traditionally washed, Cauca coffees are generally characterized as clean, soft, and fragrant, with pronounced caramelized aromas and carrying flavors tending toward high acidity with discernible sweet and floral notes, a medium body, and a balanced overall impression. Amid this backdrop, Finca El Paraiso truly caught the specialty coffee world’s attention when Diego Samuel made it to the Top 10 of the 2018 Cup of Excellence with a double anaerobic Bourbon, and again counted among the 2019 winners with a washed anaerobic Castillo. Five years on from their first COE accolade and 15 years after Finca El Paraiso’s founding, the family emblem Finca Paraiso has come to encompass six more farms — Villa Rosita, Villa Alejandro, Villa Esperanza, Sur, El Rubi, and El Manizales — and their family’s dream continues to prosper while empowering the communities they work with to succeed. They do this through INDESTEC’s six action pillars — Technology, Knowledge Management, Collaboration, Sustainable Marketing, Resource Management, and Rural Alliances. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The Caturra Chiroso variety reportedly developed from genetic mutations in the high-altitude mountains of Antioquia, Colombia. It was a mutation that permitted this variety to thrive amid atypically colder temperatures and low light intensity, which spur the increased development of multiple compounds in the coffee cherries, such as monoterpenes known to generate more pronounced flavor profiles. Finca El Paraiso and INDESTEC's ingenuity lies in having thoroughly studied, implemented, and documented their simultaneously structured and creative processing methods and techniques at such a high level of granularity that allows for consistent repeatability of their approaches and effectively unconstrains their potential to increase the diversity of probable flavor profiles, depending on the customers' preferences, varieties on hand, and the prevailing terroir conditions at the time of processing. To consistently achieve the desired cup profiles, precision in configuring the different processing parameters at every significant phase is a hallmark of harvesting, sorting, fermentation, and drying at Finca El Paraiso. For our Caturra Chiroso, a combination of 90% ripe coffee cherries and 10% half-ripe cherries were collected, with the intention of maintaining a substantial portion of spice-tinged, citrusy precursors in the coffee cherries’ pulp. The standard pre-cleaning step was then conducted at the processing plant by removing leaves, branches, and other impurities, followed by flotation to facilitate the selection of the most optimal cherries that would proceed to the following phases of post-harvest processing. Before entering the fermentation phase, the cherries were first disinfected with ozone to rid them of extraneous microbiological load, which would likely misdirect the fermentation phase. Once disinfected, the cherries were placed in stainless steel fermentation tanks for an initial inertization step where CO2 was injected, precluding oxygen and preventing the compounds in the coffee pulp from oxidizing prematurely. The first stage of the double fermentation of this lot involved the generation of gases, such as CO2, in the cherry, which marked the start of the anaerobic fermentation phase, as pressure gradually increased within the tanks and prompted the active transfer of fluids from the pulp to the seeds, while temperature was maintained at 18°C and pressure at 20 psi, for a period of 48 hours – and after which it was pulped. The second stage of the double fermentation involved inoculating a specific co-culture of yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (from El Paraiso’s extensive library) whose metabolism works to accentuate the citrus notes and vibrance of the Caturra Chiroso variety. Inoculation was done in proportions of 250 mL of culture medium per kilogram of coffee in mucilage, after which the coffee went into an anaerobic fermentation phase with the recirculation fluids from fermentation, for 48 hours, with gradual increases in pressure up to 20 psi and at a temperature of 18°C. Thermal Shock Washing was done by quickly turning up the temperature of the fermentation fluids to 40°C, rapidly opening up the membranes and pores of the coffee beans and facilitating the attachment of the abundant aroma and flavor precursors in the fermentation medium to them, and immediately following it with a wash using 12°C cold water to seal the coffee beans’ pores, locking the aroma and flavor precursors in. Otherwise, these precursors, such as the esters, aldehydes, organic acids, and alcohols produced by the metabolism of the earlier mentioned co-culture of yeasts and bacteria as they consumed the coffee mucilage, would have remained in the leachate (i.e., not absorbed into the coffee bean), because the parchment and silver film covering the coffee beans are difficult to penetrate before Thermal Shock, and would then have wastefully just been washed off. As for the crucial drying phase, Finca El Paraiso’s custom drying and dehumidifying technology was used. It was designed with consideration to the usually highly volatile and thermolabile compounds generated during fermentation and genetically inherent in the coffees. As such, it removes moisture by mass transfer, allowing the drying phase to be accomplished without high temperatures, and thereby making way for a less abrupt transition to seed dormancy. This, in effect, permits the coffee to be stored for extended periods without the risk of presenting quality defects and guarantees the highest possible quality of the final green coffee.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/colombia-caturra-chiroso-finca-el-paraiso
Rwanda - Fugi Lot N56,"apricot jam, berries, liquorice candy, full body",55.00,"Description Description Producer: Baho Coffee / Emmanuel RusatiraLocation: Nyaruguru DistrictVariety: Red BourbonProcess: Natural AnaerobicAltitude: 1550 – 1870 MASLCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Emmanuel Rusatira founded Baho Coffee, intending to help to improve the livelihood of small coffee farmers in Rwanda. His empathy for their life struggles stems from having been born into a smallholding coffee-farming family himself. He came to a deeper understanding of the material challenges they face throughout his years directly working with them as a coffee washing station manager and realized the true extent of their plight when he oversaw upwards of 30 washing stations across the country when he was working as a Department Head of Specialty, Sustainability, and Certification. The foundations for a quality-focused coffee industry established by the Rwandese government to revive the nation after the 1994 genocide —where Emmanuel lost his parents and brother — served not only as a source of hope for survivors like him but also served as the solid ground upon which they could rebuild their lives. Emmanuel decided that the evocative Rwandese word ""baho,"" literally meaning ""have life,"" best captures and conveys his company's reason for being — which is for his smallholding coffee farmer partners to have better lives. 950 smallholder farmers bring their cherries to the Fugi Washing Station in the Southwestern Province of Rwanda, between the Nyungwe National Forest and the border with Burundi. It is solely dedicated to producing specialty coffee and has gained a reputation for unmatched micro-lots resulting from the combination of favorable climatic conditions, nutrient-balanced soils, appropriate farming practices, and purposeful post-harvest processing. The farmers are recognized and rewarded by Baho Coffee for cultivating high-quality cherries and delivering these to the washing station through premium prices and a second, bonus payment. Emmanuel also helps their community to make its members feel they are part of the company’s growth by providing health insurance and extending financial support for the children’s school-related expenses. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Bourbon is the only variety that made it to the Cup of Excellence the last time the auction was conducted in Rwanda. This points to Bourbon’s propensity for taking in the best qualities of terroir, which then translate into desirable qualities in the cup. Amid a dominantly washed process-oriented industry, Emmanuel sought to be one of the pioneers of natural and honey processing in Rwanda after visiting Costa Rica, where he witnessed how these methods could multiply the trajectories of flavor creation. He applied this learning in Baho to widen their coffees’ range of flavors beyond the usual associations with the bold brightness of classic Kenyans and hints of Ethiopian florality. This lot’s jammy and candy-like qualities were emphasized through the natural anaerobic process while giving way to a touch of mildly aromatic spice and enhancing body. At Baho Coffee, the initial steps to process cherries are standardized. It starts with a day of intensive sorting in complete shade, to ensure only the ripest of cherries picked not more than 2 to 3 hours prior, and without any visible defects, proceed to the next steps. The sorted cherries are then floated in a large container, whereby the floaters are removed, and only the densest ones go into processing as higher-grade lots. In this case, the densest cherries were fermented in sealed containers to tone down acidity and intensify sweetness. Then, they were placed on drying beds within a custom-built parabolic drying facility akin to a greenhouse, to protect them from rain and too much sunlight. This drying phase can last from 50 to 55 days. During this period, the cherries are layered singly with a maximum depth of 2 to 4 cm and turned hourly for the first five days, and then every two hours until day 20. The ambient temperature and that of the coffee are closely monitored to control the pace of drying with the intention of keeping it slow. By recording temperature and moisture at regular intervals daily, the processing team can adjust their activities accordingly, whenever key indicators for drying fall outside of the target thresholds. For example, workers might shift the cherries more frequently or cover them with a mesh, or both, to prevent over-fermentation and the formation of molds, which would otherwise turn up in the cup as undesirable flavors indicative of defects. The drying phase ends upon reaching a moisture content of 11%, at which point the coffee in dried cherry is packed and kept in a dry warehouse until it needs to be milled.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/rwanda-fugi-lot-n56

Finca Las Cascaritas is the farm he inherited from his father and currently operates with his mother, herself a third-generation coffee farmer. Together they grow several coffee varieties such as Parainema, Bourbon, and Obata. The farm sits on hilly and tree-covered terrain covering 3.5 hectares at altitudes1230 MASL to 1300 MASL. The diversity of plant life includes pine trees native to the region, as well as banana, American walnut and hazel pine. In addition to natural, honey, and washed specialty coffees, Hidardo started to work on experimental microlots in 2015 to explore the possibilities of developing unusual cup profiles. Using non-traditional processes on lesser-known varietals has led him to produce coffees with pronounced fruity and winey notes that would appeal to consumers with more adventurous preferences. The Exporter CAFESMO is a collective of 250+ smallholder farmers based in the Honduran coffee-growing region close to Guatemala and El Salvador. Their coffee farms are bordered by the country’s highest peaks, Cerro Pital in the west, and the Guisayote National Reserve and the Pacayita volcano on the other side. The mountainous topography creates micro-climates beneficial to different coffees, such as Parainema, Pacas, Lempira, Catuaí, Obatá, Colombia, and IHCAFE90. Their members’ harvests are processed in their own centralized facility, which has a wet mill, drying patios, a dry mill, and a cupping lab. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The Parainema variety is a hybrid bred for its resistance to coffee rust disease and nematodes. Previously more recognized for its resilience and yield productivity, it has been gaining more attention for good cup quality. Its commendable flavor potential was confirmed when it won in the 2017 Honduran Cup of Excellence. In the natural anaerobic process, the ripe cherries were fermented in sealed containers, eliminating oxygen and allowing carbon dioxide to accumulate. This slowed down the decomposition of sugars in the coffee and resulted in a nuanced flavor profile with enhanced sweetness, a richer body, and a suitable level of acidity.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/honduras-finca-las-cascaritas-lot-90

Six years working in coffee, Sidama Bensa-born Tamiru saw the great disconnect between the exceptional flavors and high cup quality potential of his hometown's coffees and the way these were being undervalued across the market. It was also too clear to him how this put the smallholder coffee-growing families and the country's coffee industry at a huge disadvantage. A friend of Tamiru winning the 2020 Ethiopia Cup of Excellence inspired him to personally contribute to a solution by starting his company, Alo Coffee. Through Alo Coffee, he is able to provide the means for smallholders to process their laboriously cultivated, inherently organic, and flavor-rich coffee cherries into distinctive lots of the highest quality, and then match them with the specialty coffee communities that recognize their value and properly reward it. Alo Village is the site of the company’s processing headquarters where the coffee growers in the vicinity bring their coffee cherries for post-harvest processing.

Like the rest of the smallholder farmers in the country, the inhabitants of Alo Village rely on the farmlands granted to their families by the government for income mostly from coffee and food mostly comprising false banana and maize. Since each parcel covers about 1 – 2 hectares at most, coffee yields by household are constrained and volumes do not reach marketable levels, until they are aggregated by producers like Alo Coffee. On their own, each family and the community do not have the most current knowhow and sufficient resources to increase their farms’ productivity, nor to maintain and enhance the quality of the soils as well as that of their coffee cherries post-harvest. The involvement of quality-oriented and eco-socially committed specialty coffee producers like Alo Coffee contributes to alleviating the livelihood of the coffee-farming families, such as in Alo Village. To immediately benefit the smallholder coffee growers, Alo Coffee purchases their coffee cherries at a significant premium that provides a decent income to cover household essentials and their children’s education-related expenses. With a view for the longer term, Alo Coffee also provides direct assistance to the smallholder farmers through knowledge-sharing around better practices in agronomy, cultivation, farm maintenance, and harvesting, while initiating and funding community development projects such as building schools in the communities within their scope. Further, by overseeing the end-to-end conduct of post-harvest processing, Alo Coffee unburdens the smallholders of the related risks and costs, enabling them to focus their attention and energy on maintaining the natural, unblemished condition of the land and looking after their coffee trees to ensure they flourish. By association with Tamiru and Alo Coffee, coffee-growing communities like Alo Village also have a better chance of their concerns and interests being acknowledged, advanced, and addressed by influential stakeholders across the industry. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process ‘Ethiopian heirloom’ is the general term commonly used to identify coffee originating from Ethiopia. It covers two classifications: Jimma Agricultural Research Center (JARC) varieties and regional landrace varieties. JARC varieties were developed and released to improve the productivity and livelihood of smallholder coffee farmers, to boost the country's coffee industry. These varieties are promoted and bred because of their good quality (when grown at the recommended elevations), resistance to or tolerance of adverse elements, and adaptability to diverse environmental conditions. There are 40+ JARC varieties comprised mostly of pure line selections and a handful of hybrids. Regional landraces, meanwhile, are varieties that propagate in the wild, without regulated interventions. Sidama Bensa-grown 74158, a JARC variety generally observed to express Geisha-esque floral, citrus, and honeyed notes, has consistently ranked among the best at the Ethiopia Cup of Excellence and fetched the highest prices at the auction. With an extended natural anaerobic fermentation process, this Alo Village lot’s cup character was directed toward nectarous and juicy cup with the complex sweetness and balanced acidity of ripe summer fruits accented by an evident florality.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-alo-village-anaerobic-120-hours
"Panama - Don Eduardo, Savage Coffees","lavender, red plum, white grapes, pomegranate",275.00,"Description Description Producer: Savage Coffees / Don Eduardo EstateLocation: Boquete, Chiriqui, PanamaVariety: Green Tip GeishaProcess: Natural Carbonic MacerationAltitude: 1700-1900 MASLCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Jamison Savage of Finca Deborah, Iris Estate, and Savage Coffees is known throughout the specialty coffee world due to his pioneering methods. Engaged in progressive processing techniques and farming practices respectful of nature, Jamison lets the most favorable, naturally occurring sensory nuances of a coffee shine on the palate. It’s a feat accomplished by few and evidently appreciated worldwide, as national and world coffee competitors frequently choose to showcase his coffees. 2016 saw his prowess shine brighter when Taiwan’s Berg Wu won the World Barista Championship using a Geisha from Finca Deborah. Since then, numerous national champions have entrusted Jamison to design coffees for their routines on the world stage. Among them are our very own WBrC representative David Disuanco and France's Charity Cheung. It was in the early 2000s when Jamison, at the height of his finance career in the US, decided a change was in order. He longed for a freer lifestyle to give himself and his family a chance to spend more time outdoors and to travel. At the same time, he was looking for a real estate asset to fill a gap in his investment portfolio. In our 2022 Producer’s Talk, Jamison shared that they were choosing between Panama and New Zealand. Panama eventually won out for practical reasons and the sheer beauty and promise of the land. Their deliberation and preparation took about five years and culminated in 2008, the year the Savage family uprooted and started anew on foreign soil. They made their new home in the Volcan region of the Chiriqui province, the seat of Panama Geisha cultivation and home to Finca Deborah, Iris Estate, and Savage Coffees. Savage Coffees is a collaboration between Jamison Savage and boutique coffee producers in the highlands of Boquete Valley and Volcan, Chiriqui — also known as Panama’s Valley of Flowers and Eternal Spring. The community’s heritage expertise is built on generations of deep commitment to quality and close attention to detail. Paired with years of disciplined experimentation, Savage Coffees have consistently delivered podium-finishing coffees reflecting the land's natural character. Savage Coffees x Don Eduardo Estate Don Eduardo Estate is owned and operated by 4th generation Boquetenian, Harold Sabin. He was born into an agricultural family and grew up instilled with reverence for diligent work and an unwavering aspiration toward excellence. Throughout his formative years, his father, Harold Sr., and grandfather, Juan Eduardo Castillo, role-modeled deep love for their land, rigor in production, and respect for the people working on their estate. With 12,000+ Panama Geisha trees provided by Savage Coffees in 2016, the Estate came into being as a higher-end specialty coffee endeavor. In collaboration with Savage Coffees, the Geisha were established at an elevation of more than 1,800 masl where they thrive, enshrouded by the dense Boquete rainforest canopy, and develop sugar-rich coffee cherries, dense with the most desirable flavor precursors. Through the Savage Coffees Partnership Farm Program, Don Eduardo Estate coffee cherries are processed with purpose and precision, revealing their full potential. With Savage Coffees’ network of renowned global roasters, these spectacular coffees reach the specialty coffee connoisseurs best able to appreciate them. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The process for this Don Eduardo Estate Green Tip Geisha started with harvesting perfectly ripe cherries, registering 21-24 on the BRIX meter. These cherries were twice sorted and selected before being deposited into hermetically sealed, stainless steel tanks, where they remained for upwards of 100 hours. During this period, CO2 was introduced at regular intervals amid a controlled and regulated fermentation environment, allowing the coffee seeds to absorb high fruit notes and finer aromatics from the cherry itself. Temperature and PH were monitored throughout this duration, ensuring these variables stayed within pre-defined limits. Following their extended stay inside the sealed tanks, the cherries were removed and laid out on the three-tiered, raised African bed system designed by Jamison. Temperatures, humidity, and airflow were also maintained within specific parameters in the shaded drying areas, also referred to as dry houses, as the cherries were consistently and carefully shifted throughout the day for even drying. These steps were carried out to prevent undesired microbial activity from occurring and to promote the development only of desired flavors. The cherries spent around 20 days in the drying phase before reaching the proper moisture level of approximately 11%. To protect the quality that had painstakingly been created, they were then bagged in Grain-pro and stored under optimal conditions of cool and stable temperatures for a reposo or seasoning process critical in Jamison's stringent end-to-end QC protocol. In reposo, the coffee's moisture content stabilized while allowing it to keep absorbing more flavor from its parchment or shell, before being hulled and further sorted by size, density, and color, and finally shipped to us. About the Panama Geisha Panama Geisha, of which Green Tip Geisha is one variation, is a rare, delicate, and complex variety well-loved for its sweet florality and citrus highlights. Since its debut win at the Best of Panama auction in 2004, it has kept specialty coffee lovers everywhere captivated by its endless possibilities, delicacy, complexity, and clarity of flavors. As such, it is often showcased on coffee competition stages by a great number of coffee champions, and it also continues to fetch the highest prices. While a coffee’s truest intrinsic qualities are still largely believed to be showcased best by traditional washed processing due to the demucilaging, washing, and scrubbing steps removing all traces of fruit from the bean, the expertise of seasoned and passionate producers like Jamison Savage allows them to direct the flavor character of the Panama Geisha towards a seemingly endless diversity of delightfully surprising trajectories. They do this through the purposeful implementation of traditional methods like the natural and honey processes, as well as intentional and innovative processing styles, such as this Natural Carbonic Maceration process, which add to the complexity of the cup’s character — for example, more layers of flavor or better mouthfeel — without compromising its inherent qualities from terroir and variety.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/panama-don-eduardo

They won the Producer of the Year Award in 2022, which followed their two peat victories in 2018 for the Washed Geisha category and in 2019 for both Washed and Natural. A coffee company founded in 1918 by Robert Lamastus, they have evolved with the times under the leadership of Robert's son Thatcher, grandson Wilford Sr., and great-grandson Wilford Jr. They have accrued the most BOP awards to date. Their four farms are Elida, El Burro, Luito, and Lulo, each one benefitting from discrete microclimates which, together with variety, are primarily responsible for the intricacies and flavor potential of their coffees. El Burro Estate is among the southernmost coffee farms in Panama, nearest to the Pacific Ocean. Part of the Estate falls within the protected ecological forest reserve, Baru Volcano National Park (BVNP). As such, it benefits from abundant forest cover, nutrient-rich volcanic soils, and a specific combination of different temperatures, winds, and precipitation, comprising the unique microclimate that translates to the distinctive flavors of each cup of El Burro Geisha. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Recognizing they have been blessed with the ideal terroir, the Lamastus family profoundly believes their coffees are a gift from Mother Nature. Respectful of that, they favor innovations in drying techniques rather than experimenting with inoculation during fermentation. They also implement classic washed, natural, and honey processes. No matter the method, Lamastus Family Estates enforce strict protocols at every stage to achieve excellent quality consistently. This El Burro Panama Geisha underwent the traditional natural process, where carefully handpicked red-burgundy to grape-colored cherries were first left untouched overnight. The next morning they were placed directly on drying beds where they stayed for no more than 30 days. Through this process, in contrast with washed, the interaction of the coffee bean with the whole cherry allowed for fruitier and sweeter qualities to come through, as in the complementary layers of candied and caramel sweetness balanced by berry and citrusy acidities enlaced with the florality of jasmine. While a coffee’s truest intrinsic qualities are still largely believed to be showcased best by traditional washed processing due to the demucilaging, washing, and scrubbing steps removing all traces of fruit from the bean, the expertise of seasoned and passionate producers like Wilford Sr. allows them to direct the flavor character of their coffees, like the Panama Geisha, towards a seemingly endless diversity of delightfully surprising trajectories through other methods. They do this through the purposeful implementation of other traditional methods like the natural and honey processes, as well as intentional and innovative processing styles, all of which add to the complexity of the cup’s character — for example with added layers of flavor or improved mouthfeel — without compromising its inherent sensorial qualities from terroir and variety.

Their activities aim to honor every facet of coffee by producing exclusive and outstanding nano-lots. They do this by using the highest quality cherries cultivated and harvested by the smallholder farmers in the proximate communities and processing them through contemporary updates to traditional methods and styles. They named their company “Elto,” which we learned from Atiklit, means “more than passion” and “abundance” in the Sidamic language. Their aspiration is for every Elto coffee to be the most exciting cup a consumer has ever tasted. Guided by the values of honesty, respect, and humility to always remain open to learning, they are committed to engaging in meaningful relationships with their connections throughout the value chain, fostering a spirit of dynamic creativity in the industry, and showcasing the Elto rendition of Sidama Bensa coffees to the world. They consider their greatest task to be empowering their partner coffee farmers through more rewarding returns for their assiduous work. Gango Village is situated in the well-endowed Sidama Bensa highlands at 2,300 masl, neighboring more widely renowned higher-end specialty coffee cultivating communities like Hamasho Village and Bombe Village. The village was named Gango in recognition of a domestic equine hybrid of the same name in Sidamic language. The Gango are held in high regard because they embody the best traits of both the horse and the donkey— being hardier, longer-lived, and more patient than a horse, and less obstinate and more intelligent than a donkey. Gango Village is home to about 600 smallholder coffee farmers who grow inherently organic, sugar-rich, and high-quality coffee cherries inter-cropped with banana and enset, as the most common source of sustenance, in 1-2 hectare parcels of land. They harvest coffee cherries by selective handpicking, avoiding any harm to both cherries and the trees, but had been unable to fully explore the flavor potential and optimize the value of these cherries, due to limited know-how on updated cultivation and post-harvest processing best practices until Eliyas and Atiklit shared their expertise. Eliyas and Atiklit are seasoned specialty coffee professionals with grassroots working experience complementing their solid academic backgrounds. Both of them are professional cuppers trained by the Ethiopian Tea and Coffee Authority. Eliyas, who graduated with a Bsc in Marketing Management has taken the lead in Daye Bensa Coffee as Operations Manager. Meanwhile Atiklit, who graduated with a BSc in Agriculture focused on Plant Science, has built her career so far by working in Gesha Village as Coffee Processing Manager and in Daye Bensa as Lab Manager for Microlot Processing at harvest time.

After this, the barrels were emptied onto the plastic net of raised wooden beds built at a height of 120cm, allowing the fermentation juices to sufficiently drain off of them, as the whole cherries were evenly spread out at 3 - 5cm thickness for proper air circulation above and below.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-gango-anaerobic
"Panama - Geisha M71, Abu Coffee","pineapple, passion fruit, raspberry, caramel",255.00,"Description Description Producer: Jose LutrellLocation: Cañas Verdes, BoqueteVariety: GeishaProcess: Natural AnaerobicAltitude: 1,550 maslCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Jose Luttrell is the founder of Abu Coffee. He was already successful as an engineer, usually in the city and traveling overseas for work, when his father took him to revisit their family's farmlands in Boquete. This sparked his interest in specialty coffee which, in time, grew into a passion. It was after his father passed away that Jose took a deep dive into producing specialty coffee and when Abu Coffee was established. Abu (short for abuelo) was the affectionate nickname Jose's children had for their grandfather. By producing distinct and excellent coffees that could not have been grown elsewhere, and sharing them with the world, they keep his memory, and his love for coffee and Boquete alive, Abu Coffee started to become known when they won 6th place in the Geisha Washed category at the 2017 Best of Panama Competition. Their Geishas have been winning yearly at the BoP from then on. In 2021, Catuai lots they produced were also awarded in the Varietal Natural and Varietal Washed categories. These consecutive BoP wins are recognized as a particularly noteworthy achievement because Abu Coffee has been in operation for less than a decade, and is much younger than most of the producers in Panama's premier coffee-growing zone. Abu Coffee is situated in Cañas Verdes, Boquete, which benefits from a tropical forest microclimate. The coffee trees are cultivated at an average elevation of 1,550 MASL on the inclines of the Volcán Barú National Park, where the rich biodiversity is well-protected. Soils are fertile, deep, well-draining, and of volcanic origin. There is a good balance of shade from native trees, and sunlight due to the estate's location. There is also the right amount of moisture from a light tropical mist in the daytime and denser fog at dusk. These conditions help the cherries' maturation process, such that sugars intensify and enrich the beans' flavor. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The legendary Panama Geisha variety is acclaimed for its sweet florality and bright overtones. Since its debut win at the Best of Panama auction in 2004, it has kept specialty coffee lovers everywhere captivated by its delicacy, complexity, and clarity of flavors. As such, it is often showcased on coffee competition stages by a great number of coffee champions, and it also continues to fetch the highest prices. The esteemed status of the Panama Geisha is also due to its scarcity, owing to the variety’s unique genetics (responsible for its exceptional cup quality) that allows it to capture the best features of the Boquete terroir, and that are not shared by Geisha grown in other origins. The plants also require longer time to grow and more diligent care due to their delicate root systems. And, since Geisha trees have wide branch spans, they need to be spaced farther apart in the farm, resulting in less cherries per hectare at harvest. At the Abu Coffee farm in Canas Verdes, ripening takes nine to ten months, and two to three months to complete the harvesting process — all by hand-collection. Further, because the trees are very tall, hand-collecting the perfectly ripe cherries requires even the most seasoned pickers to exert more effort. For Lot M-71, the cherries were selectively collected by hand at the peak of maturation, and then sorted and floated in mountain spring water. After this, fermentation was done in two phases. The whole cherries were first fermented in open tanks for 24 hours, and then they were taken into an anaerobic dry process, under the shade, in sealed plastic tanks with thick walls for 72 hours. Sun-drying on raised beds followed and took 25 days to complete.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/panama-geisha-m71-abu-coffee

Lamastus Family Estates is a coffee company founded in 1918 by Robert Lamastus. They have evolved with the times under the leadership of Robert's son Thatcher, grandson Wilford Sr., and great-grandson Wilford Jr. and have accrued the most BOP awards to date. Their four farms are Elida, El Burro, Luito, and Sendero. Each one benefits from discrete microclimates which, together with variety, are primarily responsible for their coffees' intricacies and flavor potential. Elida Estate is the original and flagship farm. It is also the company's headquarters, where the family spends most of their time and where Wilford Sr. would be found working every day. It was named in tribute to the Lamastus family matriarch, Elida, who single-handedly raised her children and took charge of all farm operations after her husband Robert passed away in the early 1930s. Almost two decades would pass before any of her children could assist. About half of Elida Estate is located within the Volcan Baru National Park, one of Central America’s highest volcanoes, which is also a protected ecological reserve and sanctuary for exotic flora and fauna. Among the Estate’s unique world conditions are high elevation, volcanic soils, low temperatures, beneficial microorganisms, mist during the dry season, and virgin-native cloudy rain forest surrounding the coffee trees. The low night-time temperatures allow for protracted ripening of the coffee cherries, which helps make them healthier and the resulting coffee beans sweeter. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Recognizing they have been blessed with the ideal terroir, the Lamastus family profoundly believes their coffees are a gift from mother nature. Respectful of that, they veer away from inoculating the cherries during fermentation and instead favor innovation through refinements in drying, supported by a strict protocol at every stage. The Anaerobic Slow Dry (ASD) process optimizes a traditional method where cherries are first fermented in sealed tanks before being transferred to multi-layered drying beds. Apart from the deliberately prolonged drying phase, which would take at least 60 days, another innovation is using a special plastic mesh and metal in the beds’ construction, not wood, as used by the first Lamastus Family Estate generation. Through ASD, this Elida Catuai micro-lot developed confectionary sweetness and a syrupy, liquor-like character complemented by subtle acidity.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/panama-elida-estates-catuai-asd

It was established when founders Felipe Sardi and Elisa María Madriñan saw the demand for higher-end Colombian specialty coffee in stark contrast with the capability of the coffee growers to meet it. Between 2011 and 2012, they converted previous cattle farmland into a fully-equipped coffee farm focused on innovation while ensuring the well-being of the environment & the farmers. Their coffees have reaped awards on national and world coffee competition stages since 2016. 2019 was most memorable when Korea's Jooyeon Jeon used their coffee to win 1st Place in the World Barista Championship. Now in their 10th year, they continue to innovate cultivation practices, processing methods, and business models. They have re-engineered the farm from monoculture to polyculture, introduced Bio-innovation and Bio-Natural techniques, and expanded the geographic scope of their relationship coffee framework called Neighbors & Crops. The Exporter: Equation Coffee represents a small group of like-minded Panama and Colombia producers that enact eco-socially conscious choices in their coffee cultivation, processing, and marketing. They are La Palma & El Tucan, Delagua Coffee Paradise, and Creativa Coffee District. Their business model, called Neighbors & Crops, is geared towards invariably innovating and delivering premium specialty coffee while making a lasting, beneficial impact on the community and the environment. Our long-term relationship with Equation Coffee has allowed us to make internationally sought-after coffees available here in our corner of the world. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Sidra is another exotic varietal planted at the estate when it was established. It is a hybrid from Ecuador that has Red Bourbon’s body and sweetness, and Typica’s bright acidity. Recognizing Sidra’s award-winning potential, thousands more trees were planted across four terroirs at altitudes between 1650 to 1800 MASL in 2015. Not too long after, in 2019, it was this variety produced by La Palma & El Tucan that won the World Barista Championship. An anaerobic natural process was used to enhance Sidra’s complex profile. Ripe cherries were hand-sorted, placed in sealed tanks to ferment, and then laid out to dry on raised beds for 30 to 45 days. In this drying phase, the cherry has more time to interact with the bean’s mucilage, allowing the favorable attributes of the coffee to develop to the fullest extent possible. This resulted in a cup with winey acidity and a silky body. La Palma & El Tucan produces natural processed coffees in small batches because of the usually high humidity levels that present a challenge during the critical drying phase. Outside the narrow window in a year when humidity levels are ideal, a mechanical dryer is prudently used for the coffees to reach the required moisture level. The cherries are also shifted about every two hours to ensure even drying and to avoid off flavors from the growth molds or fungus. This nano-lot belongs to the estate’s Heroes Series, which comprises 90+ coffees and makes up 10% of their total production.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/colombia-sidra-nano-lot-14

They started the company with a noble sense of responsibility to contribute to nation-building by directly participating in advancing the country’s agricultural agenda, being its predominant source of both national income and pride. In so doing, EDN is among the enablers of bettering coffee-growing families’ welfare while helping introduce improvements and innovations to traditional know-how, thereby supporting efforts to perpetuate the country’s intangible heritage in coffee. Quality-focused and customer-oriented, the company has invested in nurturing its ties with peer producers and the smallholder farmers within their scope, skill-building within their teams, as well as building out the appropriate infrastructure to meet the requirements of its global customers. As such, they have been gaining renown for their professionalism and reliability as a provider of higher-end specialty coffees in small and difficult-to-acquire batches amid an increasingly challenging milieu. Washed, natural, honey, and anaerobic post-harvest processing methods are implemented across EDN’s processing sites located in two of only three eminent coffee-growing administrative regions recognized at the Ethiopian Cup of Excellence from 2021 to 2022, both in the south. First is SNNPR (i.e. the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region), where the neighboring Yirgacheffe and Gedeb districts within the Gedeo zone are located. Second is the Oromia Region, where the Hambela district within the Guji zone is. The lush, verdant, and mountainous Guji terrain situated at 1,950 to 2,300 masl receives abundant rainfall and is rich in fertile soils, comprising a conducive, shaded environment for diverse coffee trees to flourish. Coffee farming families in the Hambela district customarily use traditional, and by default organic, practices to cultivate different varieties alongside other food crops across 1 to 2 hectares of land. Intercropping is a means for them to have a steady food source while maximizing the earning opportunities brought about by the high quality and distinct profiles of their coffee. About 450 to 500 families in the Benti Nenka Village entrust the best of their harvests to EDN’s nearby eponymous processing site in the hope that their hard work will yield commensurate rewards. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Kurume is one of the varieties native to the Gedeo zone and reportedly originated from the Yirgacheffe. Collectively, coffee varieties that have naturally occurred and proliferated in Ethiopia are referred to as “regional landraces.” “Ethiopian heirloom,” meanwhile, is the general term commonly used to identify coffee originating from Ethiopia. It covers regional landraces and Jimma Agricultural Research Center (JARC) varieties, which were developed and released to improve the productivity and livelihood of smallholder coffee farmers and boost the country's coffee industry. 74112 is one of the 40+ JARC varieties that are promoted and bred because of their good quality when grown at the recommended elevations, resistance to or tolerance of adverse elements, and adaptability to diverse environments. Ethiopian heirlooms are popularly observed to express archetypal fruity and floral qualities and a complex character. The properly ripe cherries are carefully hand-picked by the farmers and delivered to the Benti Nenka Processing Site, where flotation is done to spot and remove overripe, underripe, and damaged cherries. EDN employees then do a further visual assessment to ensure only the cherries at optimum ripeness proceed to the anaerobic fermentation phase, which ensues in pressurized and oxygen-free containers. Throughout fermentation, there is strict monitoring and control to ensure the necessary sugar content, temperature, and pressure levels are met and maintained, and oxygen is consistently absent, to achieve the desired cup profile. After 10 to 12 days in the anaerobic fermentation phase, the cherries are transferred from the fermentation tanks to the drying beds, which had been designed to allow for proper air circulation. Throughout the drying phase, which could last from 15 to 20 days until the target moisture level of 11% is reached, the cherries are periodically churned to achieve the required degree of fermentation. Washed Guji coffees tend to exhibit floral aromatics, mild sweetness alongside a prominent brightness, and even hints of mint like in lemongrass. As a Natural Anaerobic, this Guji Hambela micro-lot instead expresses an intensified, candy-like and tropical sweetness, accented by streaks of rounded stonefruit and berry-like acidities.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-benti-nenka-guji-hambela

Faced with the predicament of inadequate personal resources — as do the majority of smallholders in the country — Chelbesa Village coffee farming families are empowered by producers like EDN Coffee toward realizing greater returns for their hard work, by sustainably improving and maintaining the quality of their coffees. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Wolisho, Dega, and Kurume are varieties native to the Gedeo zone that reportedly originated from Yirgacheffe. Being indigenous to this locale, they are better adapted to its terroir and, as such, are believed to express the complex fruit and floral nuances of Ethiopian coffees are renowned for to a heightened degree, compared to varieties introduced from other areas. Following traditional practices, Chelbesa Village farmers cultivate several varieties in small plots of land without artificial inputs, making the coffees organic by default. Many of them depend on the natural proliferation of the coffee plants, which grow into trees close to each other, which in some cases, can inhibit the identification of the individual coffee varieties at the time of harvest. At harvest season, the head of household designates the trees which are ripe for picking — the ones with deep red cherries — and it is conventionally women, recognized to have the acumen for it, who lead in this task. Throughout, they take care not to strip the trees of leaves or harm any of the branches. The cherries are then brought to EDN’s Yirgacheffe Gedeb processing center, where they are pre-cleaned and sorted before being laid out on the raised beds to dry. The critical challenge of natural processing lies in enabling only the desired flavors to develop in order for a high level of quality to be achieved. To do this, it is necessary for the lots to include only healthy, ripe cherries. Further, the cherries must dry evenly until the target moisture level is reached, in a process that takes between 10 to 12 days. Facilitating both requires the keen attention and careful manual labor of the farmers who select and sort the cherries, and the washing station workers who monitor the moisture levels and carry out activities like turning the cherries over at regular intervals and covering them with the appropriate material in case of unfavorable weather conditions. In this lot, the natural process gave way to tropical sweetness with gently crisp and tangy fruit highlights, tempered by soft berry acidity.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/yirgacheffe-ethiopia-banko-chelbesa
"Panama - Symbiosis, Iris Estate","jasmine, strawberry, dried mango, clementine",355.00,"Description Description Producer: Jamison Savage / Iris EstateLocation: Volcan, Chiriqui, PanamaVariety: Green Tip GeishaProcess: Natural AnaerobicAltitude: 1850-2300 MASLCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Jamison Savage of Finca Deborah, Iris Estate, and Savage Coffees is known throughout the specialty coffee world due to his pioneering methods. Engaged in progressive processing techniques and farming practices respectful of nature, Jamison lets the most favorable, naturally occurring sensory nuances of a coffee shine on the palate. It’s a feat accomplished by few and evidently appreciated worldwide, as national and world coffee competitors frequently choose to showcase his coffees. 2016 saw his prowess shine brighter when Taiwan’s Berg Wu won the World Barista Championship using a Geisha from Finca Deborah. Since then, numerous national champions have entrusted Jamison to design coffees for their routines on the world stage. Among them are our very own WBrC representative David Disuanco and France's Charity Cheung. It was in the early 2000s when Jamison, at the height of his finance career in the US, decided a change was in order. He longed for a freer lifestyle to give himself and his family a chance to spend more time outdoors and to travel. At the same time, he was looking for a real estate asset to fill a gap in his investment portfolio. In our 2022 Producer’s Talk, Jamison shared that they were choosing between Panama and New Zealand. Panama eventually won out for practical reasons and the sheer beauty and promise of the land. Their deliberation and preparation took about five years and culminated in 2008, the year the Savage family uprooted and started anew on foreign soil. They made their new home in the Volcan region of the Chiriqui province, the seat of Panama Geisha cultivation and home to Finca Deborah, Iris Estate, and Savage Coffees. Iris Estate, the latest in Jamison’s pursuit of the perfect cup, is a collaboration with Sasa Sestic of Project Origin and Elvin Chin Wei of Cloud Catcher. Situated at extreme elevations amid the pristine environs of Volcan, Iris Estate’s founders believe it is where all the ideal conditions converge for ‘super-specialty’ coffee to ‘create itself.’ The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Panama Geisha cherries take their time to sweeten in the cooler temperatures at the extreme altitudes of Iris Estate, aided by the right amount of shade and sunlight owing to the luxuriant rainforest cover and the farm’s favorable orientation to the sun. Processed with tact and intention, Iris Estate Symbiosis is another eloquent expression of the very land it grew on. Symbiosis started with harvesting perfectly ripe Geisha cherries, registering 21-24 on the BRIX meter. These cherries were twice sorted and selected before being deposited into hermetically sealed, stainless steel tanks, where they remained for upwards of 100 hours. During this period, temperature and PH were monitored, ensuring these variables stayed within pre-defined limits. Following their extended stay inside the sealed tanks, the cherries were removed and laid out on the three-tiered, raised African bed system designed by Jamison. Throughout the drying phase, temperatures, humidity, and airflow were also maintained within specific parameters in the shaded drying areas, also referred to as dry houses, as the cherries were consistently and carefully shifted throughout the day for even drying. These steps were carried out to prevent undesired microbial activity from occurring and to promote the development only of desired flavors. The cherries spent around 30 days on the drying beds before reaching the proper moisture level of approximately 11%. To protect the quality that had painstakingly been created, they were then bagged in Grain-pro and stored under optimal conditions of cool and stable temperatures for a reposo or seasoning process critical in Jamison's stringent end-to-end QC protocol. In reposo, the coffee's moisture content stabilized while allowing it to keep absorbing more flavor from its parchment or shell, before being hulled and further sorted by size, density, and color, and finally shipped to us. About the Panama Geisha Panama Geisha, of which Green Tip Geisha is one variation, is a rare, delicate, and complex variety well-loved for its sweet florality and citrus highlights. Since its debut win at the Best of Panama auction in 2004, it has kept specialty coffee lovers everywhere captivated by its endless possibilities, delicacy, complexity, and clarity of flavors. As such, it is often showcased on coffee competition stages by a great number of coffee champions, and it also continues to fetch the highest prices. While a coffee’s truest intrinsic qualities are still largely believed to be showcased best by traditional washed processing due to the demucilaging, washing, and scrubbing steps removing all traces of fruit from the bean, the expertise of seasoned and passionate producers like Jamison Savage allows them to direct the flavor character of the Panama Geisha towards a seemingly endless diversity of delightfully surprising trajectories. They do this through the purposeful implementation of traditional methods like the natural and honey processes, as well as intentional and innovative processing styles, such as this Natural Anaerobic process, which add to the complexity of the cup’s character — for example, more layers of flavor or better mouthfeel — without compromising its inherent qualities from terroir and variety.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/panama-symbiosis
Ethiopia - Alo Village Archers Lot Honey,"lavender, bergamot, mandarine, peach, green tea",145.00,"Description Description Producer: Tamiru Tadesse / Alo CoffeeLocation: Alo Village, Bensa, SidamaVariety: 74158Process: Anaerobic HoneyAltitude: 2,450 maslCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Only a year into establishing Alo Coffee Export Plc, Tamiru Tadesse had already managed to foster a commendable reputation among specialty coffee connoisseurs around the world, with a burgeoning client base across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In 2021 Tamiru won 1st Place at the Ethiopia Cup of Excellence & advanced closer toward his goal of bringing greater recognition and rewards to Sidama Bensa coffee farmers, whose hard work and dedication make top-quality coffees possible. Six years working in coffee, Sidama Bensa-born Tamiru saw the great disconnect between the exceptional flavors and high cup quality potential of his hometown's coffees and the way these were being undervalued across the market. It was also too clear to him how this put the smallholder coffee-growing families and the country's coffee industry at a huge disadvantage. A friend of Tamiru winning the 2020 Ethiopia Cup of Excellence inspired him to personally contribute to a solution by starting his company, Alo Coffee. Through Alo Coffee, he is able to provide the means for smallholders to process their laboriously cultivated, inherently organic, and flavor-rich coffee cherries into distinctive lots of the highest quality, and then match them with the specialty coffee communities that recognize their value and properly reward it. Alo Village is the site of the company’s processing headquarters where the coffee growers in the vicinity bring their coffee cherries for post-harvest processing. It is situated at remarkably high elevations from 2,400 masl. Like the rest of the smallholder farmers in the country, the inhabitants of Alo Village rely on the farmlands granted to their families by the government for income mostly from coffee and food mostly comprising false banana and maize. Since each parcel covers about 1 – 2 hectares at most, coffee yields by household are constrained and volumes do not reach marketable levels, until they are aggregated by producers like Alo Coffee. On their own, each family and the community do not have the most current knowhow and sufficient resources to increase their farms’ productivity, nor to maintain and enhance the quality of the soils as well as that of their coffee cherries post-harvest. The involvement of quality-oriented and eco-socially committed specialty coffee producers like Alo Coffee contributes to alleviating the livelihood of the coffee-farming families, such as in Alo Village. To immediately benefit the smallholder coffee growers, Alo Coffee purchases their coffee cherries at a significant premium that provides a decent income to cover household essentials and their children’s education-related expenses. With a view for the longer term, Alo Coffee also provides direct assistance to the smallholder farmers through knowledge-sharing around better practices in agronomy, cultivation, farm maintenance, and harvesting, while initiating and funding community development projects such as building schools in the communities within their scope. Further, by overseeing the end-to-end conduct of post-harvest processing, Alo Coffee unburdens the smallholders of the related risks and costs, enabling them to focus their attention and energy on maintaining the natural, unblemished condition of the land and looking after their coffee trees to ensure they flourish. By association with Tamiru and Alo Coffee, coffee-growing communities like Alo Village also have a better chance of their concerns and interests being acknowledged, advanced, and addressed by influential stakeholders across the industry. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process ‘Ethiopian heirloom’ is the general term commonly used to identify coffee originating from Ethiopia. It covers two classifications: Jimma Agricultural Research Center (JARC) varieties and regional landrace varieties. JARC varieties were developed and released to improve the productivity and livelihood of smallholder coffee farmers, to boost the country's coffee industry. These varieties are promoted and bred because of their good quality (when grown at the recommended elevations), resistance to or tolerance of adverse elements, and adaptability to diverse environmental conditions. There are 40+ JARC varieties comprised mostly of pure line selections and a handful of hybrids. Regional landraces, meanwhile, are varieties that propagate in the wild, without regulated interventions. Sidama Bensa-grown 74158, a JARC variety generally observed to express Geisha-esque floral, citrus, and honeyed notes, has consistently ranked among the best at the Ethiopia Cup of Excellence and fetched the highest prices at the auction. The Archers Lot Archers Lots culminate our co-founders’ creativity and technical acumen to compose truly artisanal specialty coffee experiences for both the discerning and adventurous specialty coffee connoisseurs, in collaboration with our closest producing partners. In this Archers-curated 120-hour anaerobic honey process, Alo Village smallholder farmers brought the perfectly ripe, hand-harvested to the Alo Washing Station, where they were screened at the door and then sorted again to ensure uniformity of the ripeness level (visually indicated by color) before being pre-cleaned and then placed in 50-60 KG plastic barrels. This was done to aid in maintaining an oxygen-free fermentation phase throughout the pre-determined 120-hour period, after which the cherries were de-pulped. Following that, the barrels were emptied onto the raised beds, as the de-pulped cherries spread out in very thin layers, allowing the fermentation juices to sufficiently drain from them. The specific instruction to maintain very thinly layered cherries throughout the sun-drying phase was deliberate, to avoid extraneous microbial activity as the coffees had already undergone the necessary fermentation in the barrels prior. The target moisture level was achieved after 14 to 18 days. As a result of this process, this cup expresses intense floral and citrus aromatics complementing its sweet succulence, harmonized by a smooth and crisp tea-like character.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-alo-village-archers-lot-honey
Kenya - Kiawamururu AA,"blackberry, dark grape, bergamot, plum",65.00,"Description Description Producer: Kiawamururu CooperativeLocation: Mukurwini, Nyeri CountyVariety: SL28, SL34, Ruiru 11Process: WashedAltitude: ﻿1600-1800 maslCrop Year: ﻿2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Coffee farming is a family enterprise for the 900 smallholders that bring their harvest to the Kiawamururu wet mill for processing. The lands they cultivate are inherited across generations, just as their coffee know-how. Familiarity with the parameters and skills critical for growing and harvesting high-quality cherries starts when the family members are very young. As children, most of them accompanied and observed their parents at work. As they grew up, more technical and practical knowledge was shared with them. They were able to actively participate when they came of age. An example is the chairman of the Kiawamururu wet mill, a third-generation coffee farmer. Farmers rely on the mill's processing facilities and expertise to maximize their cherries' sensory and, thus, commercial potential. In addition, the mill's direct relationship with buyers enables them to match the coffees with the markets that will bring the most value back to their members. There are also ongoing initiatives by the mill's management to update the farmers' knowledge of best practices in coffee planting, pruning, feeding, and controlling pests and diseases. These improve quality and sustainability in the long run. Nyeri County belongs to Kenya’s traditional coffee-growing zone in the country’s Central Region. It is situated between the Aberdare mountain range and Mount Kenya, the country's highest point. Nutrient-rich volcanic soil comprises most of the land, which along with the moderate climate, allows coffee trees to grow healthy and yield dense cherries that are packed with potential for an array of flavors. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The traditional varieties SL 28 and SL 34 have been cultivated in the country since the early 1900s. They are known for having the potential for high cup quality and high yields. Still, they are also highly vulnerable to adverse elements. The more resilient cultivar Ruiru 11 was bred and promoted to protect the farmers’ livelihood and the industry at large from an event such as the 1968 coffee berry disease epidemic from recurring. The AA-grade indicates this coffee is of the highest quality, determined by the beans’ size and density and according to the regulations governing the Kenyan coffee trade. It is a long held belief that the washed process fully unmasks a coffee’s authentic character allowing the consumer to taste variety and terroir. It is still the norm for post-harvest processing at cooperative-run coffee factories in Kenya. Selectively handpicked ripe cherries are further sorted for defects before being sent into pulping, which removes the skin and pulp from the seed. Residual mucilage is removed through fermentation in tanks, followed by washing to scrub off any remaining traces of mucilage, and a soak. By this step, the coffee seeds in parchment would have a moisture level of around 55%. This will be reduced to 10-12% by laying them out to dry on raised beds under the sun for approximately 14 days. Kenyan coffee is memorable for many specialty coffee lovers because it is generally fragrant, clean, juicy, complex, and also fuller-bodied, which is uncommon in most other fully washed coffees.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/kenya-kiawamururu-aa

Colombia - Aroma Nativo Castillo CM,"dark plum, berries, tamarind, bakers chocolate",55.00,"Description Description Producer: Luis Marcelino / Aroma NativoLocation: Acevedo, HuilaVariety: CastilloProcess: Natural Carbonic MacerationAltitude: 1,550 maslCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Luis Marcelino wholeheartedly diverged from the well-trodden path of a strategic, corporate achiever well-established in a world city to find his place in the world of coffee. The yearning to own his time and spend more of his days nearer to nature came while he was living and working in Paris. His love for drinking specialty coffee and the circumstance of his wife having ties in Colombia led him to explore opportunities for a fresh start toward what he believed to be a more fulfilling life they could build from there. Having been born and raised, and come of age, in the wine-growing highlands of his home country Portugal, he has always had an innate affinity for natural landscapes, a sense of wonder for the bounties of the land, and an inexhaustible curiosity about his part in making the big picture more beautiful. From 2017 to 2019, he spent two years traveling between France and Colombia to learn first-hand about coffee cultivation, processing, and the export/import trade. As he connected with a few farmers and seasoned producers, his interest in coffee genetics and the intricacies of processing flourished too. Taking inspiration from Ninety Plus in Panama, he pitched the idea of venturing into natural and experimental processing to a partner, who was then only producing traditional, washed coffees according to the nationally sanctioned norm. After intentional and thoroughly documented experiments with small batches, he drew up the first non-traditional protocols that formed the foundations of his company, Aroma Nativo, established in 2019. The cherries in this lot are the fruits of the hard work and dedication of a collective of coffee farmers who are part of the Veci Project. They are Miguel Castillo, Ezequiel Guzmán, Gerson Hidalgo, Juanito Salinas, José Granado, and Teodiselo Delgado. Aroma Nativo began with a processing hub based in Huila, Colombia, and a trading company headquartered in Paris, France. With the 2022 acquisition of a five-hectare farmland dedicated to cultivating rare coffee varieties that will be processed towards 90+ levels, Luis is boosting his stake in the arena of competition coffees. This comes on the heels of Aroma Nativo lots having been showcased by several coffee champions on their respective national stages — Portugal, Italy, Austria, and Sweden — and also represented in the world arena. About Veci Project In 2022, Luis implemented the Veci Project, having realized the extent to which purposeful processing could contribute to improving coffee quality and enable coffee farmers to enjoy a better quality of life when they get higher returns for their harvests. He chose the name veci, shorthand for the colloquial vecino meaning neighbor, because it reflects the spirit of solidarity among the community of farmers the project seeks to serve. Essentially, the project provides a viable alternative for coffee farmers with commendable agronomic practices to receive advance payments that aid their cash flow and also earn a premium for high-quality cherries suitable for expressing the in-demand flavor profiles sought by Aroma Nativo’s global network of renowned roasters. The Veci Project is also instrumental for Luis to effectuate his passion for sustainably contributing to uplifting the vecis’ lives through education. Since the majority of them have not yet been initiated into the contemporary methods and consequent benefits of specialty coffee, they are still most comfortable with the notion of selling their coffees to conventional processing stations to be washed and marketed primarily as commercial-grade products. To shift their mindset, Luis and his team at origin devote resources to conduct workshops covering a vast range of subjects from cultivation to post-harvest processing. Topics include: identifying coffee varieties, increasing shade cover in their farms, selective picking, and fermenting and drying their own cherries — all with the aim of improving quality and the potential to garner a higher cup score. Conscious of the youth’s declining interest in coffee farming in the blessed terroir of Huila, Veci Project puts a priority on seeking out and speaking to the new generation of coffee farmers and producers. The core of their conversations is that doing a proper job with coffee — from cultivation and harvesting to processing — presents them with better opportunities to thrive at home, where they are, than the seeming attraction of migrating to larger cities, where they might not be as equipped to make it. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The Castillo coffee variety, introduced by Colombia's national coffee research institute, Cenicafe, in 2005, was developed as an improvement over earlier cultivars like Colombia/F6 and Tabi, with a focus on resilience, productivity, and cup quality. Initially, there were concerns about its cupping potential compared to older varieties like Caturra, but innovative producers embarked on post-harvest processing experiments to demonstrate that Castillo could deliver exceptional cup quality. Traditionally, it was observed to have a dominant chocolatey and cherry-like cup profile with hints of citrus. However, through experimentation, different post-harvest processing methods have been employed to explore and enhance its flavor potential. For example, extended fermentation can create more complex flavors, adding nuances of dark chocolate, caramel, and even spices to the cup, while anaerobic fermentation would push the boundaries even further, resulting in unique and exotic cup characteristics such as florals, tropical fruits, and wine-like qualities. In Aroma Nativo, Luis used the Natural Carbonic Maceration process to reveal the tropical nuance of tamarind amid the dark fruit and chocolate-dominant cup character. Innovative processing protocols like this have not only increased awareness among Colombian coffee farmers about the potential of disease-resistant varieties like Castillo, but they have also opened a multitude of avenues for creating diverse flavor profiles. This allows farmers to be better rewarded for their hard work, as their coffees can now more strongly compete in the specialty coffee market and command the higher-end of premium prices.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/colombia-aroma-nativo-castillo-cm

The Gesha variety, along with all heirloom coffee varieties, comes from the understory of wild forests in Ethiopia. These heirloom varieties of coffee live very long lives – up to 100 years or more – and produce relatively small amounts of intensely aromatic coffee. Founder Joseph Brodsky had an opportunity in 2009 to acquire this large property (~200 hectares) and had a vision of reforesting its historic cattle farming lands with native tree species while planting the shade-loving Ethiopian Gesha coffee beneath the canopy. With its first significant production in 2014, coffee from Ninety Plus Gesha Estates was used to win the first of 5 World Brewers Cup Championships in 6 years. Ninety Plus Gesha Estates proves that coffee can be utilized to reforest and sustain tropical lands while producing the highest valued coffees in the world. In 2005, Ninety Plus Founder, Joseph Brodsky, traveled to Ethiopia for the first time and decided to make it home for the coming years, having fallen in love with the people, the food, the language, the culture, and the semi-forested coffee lands in Ethiopia’s southwest.

World and national coffee competitors have featured the Volcan Azul Geisha in their routines, such as in the 2018 Danish Brewers Cup, where it took the top award. Quality production starts with ensuring nutrient-rich soil and protection from diseases that will allow healthy coffee trees to grow. This is a cyclical exercise carried out consistently to maintain and build on the gains from the previous years. At the time of harvest, only cherries at peak ripeness are hand-picked. These are cherries whose mucilage registers at least 22% on the Brix meter, indicating optimal sugar content and allowing Alejo flexibility to select the suitable fermentation and drying techniques to produce the desired cup profiles. This lot was processed in forest shade using a Natural Anaerobic method.

He decided that the evocative Rwandese word ""baho,"" literally meaning ""have life,"" best captures and conveys his company's reason for being — which is for his smallholding coffee farmer partners to have better lives. Colombia, Nicolas Ocampo Maya, Finca La Julia Nicolas Ocampo Maya began to plant the Java variety at Finca La Julia in 2015, focusing on the rare and exotic varieties in Colombia. He added Tabi and Geisha varieties later that same year. Nicolas has, from the start, been exploring the flavor potential of their coffees through thoughtful experiments in natural, honey, and semi-washed processing and continues to improve on their practices, from cultivation to processing, aiming to maintain an extensive repertoire of higher quality coffees.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/bittersweet

The nutrient and element rich, red volcanic soil provides an ideal medium for the SL28 and SL34 varieties grown by these producers. Once the ripe cherries are picked, they are brought to the washing station by the farmers. They are then weighed and loaded into a de-pulping machine. After removing the majority of the flesh, the beans are subsequently fermented for 16 to 20 hours, before they are carefully washed and sorted by weight, ensuring that any poor quality beans are removed. Following this, they are moved to tanks where they sit under water for a further 24 hours. After soaking, the coffee is spread out on raised beds and allowed to dry for seven to 15 days. The Kainamui washing station does more than simply allow local farmers to process their coffee, it also supports its members by providing them with financial assistance for school fees, farming needs. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Varietals: The smallholders mainly have SL 28, SL 34, and Ruiru 11. Grade: AA, AB and PB refers to the bean size. Production process: Cherries are hand sorted for unripe and overripe cherries by the farmers before they go into production. A disc pulping machine removes the skin and pulp. The coffees are graded by density into 3 grades by the pulp­er. Grade 1 and 2 go separately to fermentation. Grade 3 is considered a low grade. The coffee is fermented for 16-24 hours under closed shade. After fermentation, the coffees are washed and again graded by density in wash­ing channels and are then soaked under clean water from the Gatomboya stream for 16-18 hours. Drying: Sun dried up to 21 days on African drying beds. Coffees are covered in plas­tic during midday and at night.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/kenya-kainamui

Brothers Asefa and Mulugeta Dukamo started the company with one small office and a single washing station, and the vision to uplift the lives of coffee farming families in their hometown, Daye Bensa, Sidama. While the natural environment at altitudes exceeding 2000 masl was conducive to growing high-quality coffee, enabling infrastructure to process and market it did not exist. Together with his brother Mulugeta Dukamo, he would find a way to overcome this obstacle by setting up wet and dry mills at strategic locations and, not long after, their own exporting company. Now they have 71 washing stations, 11 dry mills, and three farms, with work in progress to expand to neighboring areas Guji, Bale, and West Arsi. The majestic Bombe Village, situated among mountains at 2,230 masl, is home to a community of nearly 700 coffee farmers who share a profound connection because of their dedication to perpetuating their heritage of cultivating excellent coffees and the determination to overcome adversity to realize their family’s aspirations through coffee. Across ancestral lines, these farmers whose families include a remarkable number of children, have committedly toiled to hone their craft. They are driven by their desire to sufficiently provide for their children and pave the way for future generations to continually enjoy an improved quality of life. With assistance from Daye Bensa, they are empowered with updated know-how to sustainably nurture their farmlands, ranging from 2 to 7 hectares, which are both their sanctuary and source of livelihood. Daye Bensa’s involvement in post-harvest processing colors every harvest season with anticipation and hope because they provide the opportunity to pool cherries into commercially viable volumes and also the facilities to optimize the flavor potential of the cherries in order to deliver better value back to the farming families. Daye Bensa Coffee is one of Ethiopia's Top 5 Coffee Exporters. They supply 7,500 tons annually to 25 countries. Unlike others, they produce their own coffee on this massive scale and operate a relationship-based model with farmers, buyers, and other producers, allowing them to directly influence and improve their coffee's quality. With Kenean Dukamo, Asefa’s son and second-generation leader, on-board, Daye Bensa looks to build on their COE win by creating a division focused on ""intentional coffees.” They are also looking at creative collaborations with outside sectors like the arts or winemaking. Archers x Daye Bensa The Archers bond with Daye Bensa goes a long way back. It's also a connection marked by exhilarating milestones, such as: Archers’ first stint at the National Brewers Cup in 2021 where our co-founder and green buyer Frederick Bejo showcased a progressive rendering of Hamasho Village on-stage; our first creative processing collaboration that brought us exclusive Hamasho 192 Hrs and Gatta Warm Anaerobic Archers lots, our inaugural learning adventure at origin when we flew to Ethiopia for the CQI Q Processing 2 The Professional at Gatta Farm, Sidama Bensa, and that epic private cupping event featuring 20 cup profiles expressed by a single Ethiopian variety processed in 20 different ways. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process ‘Ethiopian heirloom’ is the general term commonly used to identify coffee originating from Ethiopia. It covers two classifications: Jimma Agricultural Research Center (JARC) varieties and regional landrace varieties. JARC varieties were developed and released to improve the productivity and livelihood of smallholder coffee farmers and boost the country's coffee industry. They are promoted and bred because of their good quality when grown at the recommended elevations, resistance to or tolerance of adverse elements, and adaptability to diverse environments. There are 40+ JARC varieties comprised mostly of pure line selections and a handful of hybrids. Regional landraces, meanwhile, are varieties that propagate in the wild, without regulated interventions. 74110 and 74112 are JARC varieties whose combined flavor potential we have grown familiar with in our years of working with Daye Bensa. Archers has offered Bombe Village Natural in 2021 and 2022. 2021 had tasting notes of mandarin orange, apricot, strawberry, and caramel, while 2022 had orange, apricot, pineapple, mixed berries, and floral honey. Both years, the crops consistently showcased a sweet, succulent, and pleasantly tart apricot note alongside prominent sweetness — caramel in 2021 and floral honey in 2022. While both years showcased diversely aromatic and fruit-forward qualities, 2022 had a wider spectrum that included berries, citrus, tropical fruit notes, as well as some florality. This 2023 Bombe Village Natural is a surprise stunner, with the heightened aromatics of serenely floral lavender and invigorating lemongrass — both of which had not been there before — intertwined with mouthwatering nectarine and the creamy sweetness of papaya.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-bombe-village

This signifies the cooperative’s capacity for efficient and quality-driven practices as a way to increase the value of their affiliated farmers’ coffee and compensate them accordingly. They operate three wet mills in one of the country’s most known coffee-growing zones, Kirinyaga county in Central Kenya, also known as the Mount Kenya region. The county is extensively forested, rich in volcanic soil, and has moderate temperatures year-round. These beneficial conditions give way to coffee trees that yield denser cherries with the potential for diverse flavors. There is also consistent county government support for coffee farmers in the form of training and access to farm inputs. Generations of farmers in this locality predominantly grow SL 28 and SL 34 varieties, as they had been working with coffee before the popularization of cultivars Ruiru 11 and Batian. The Karimikui Coffee Factory is one of the three Rung’eto Cooperative wet mills providing processing services to the smallholder farmers in its vicinity. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The traditional varieties SL 28 and SL 34 have been cultivated in the country since the early 1900s. They are known for having the potential for high cup quality and high yields. Still, they are also highly vulnerable to adverse elements. The more resilient cultivars Ruiru 11 and Batian were bred and promoted to protect the farmers’ livelihood and the industry at large from an event such as the 1968 coffee berry disease epidemic from recurring. The AA-grade indicates this coffee is of the highest quality, determined by the beans’ size and density according to the regulations governing the Kenyan coffee trade. It is a long held belief that the washed process fully unmasks a coffee’s authentic character allowing the consumer to taste variety and terroir. It is still the norm for post-harvest processing at cooperative-run coffee factories in Kenya. Selectively hand picked ripe cherries are further sorted for defects before being sent into pulping, which removes the skin and pulp from the seed. Residual mucilage is removed through fermentation in tanks, followed by washing to scrub off any remaining traces of mucilage, and a soak. By this step, the coffee seeds in parchment would have a moisture level of around 55%. This will be reduced to 10-12% by laying them out to dry on raised beds under the sun for approximately 14 days. Kenyan coffee is memorable for many specialty coffee lovers because it is generally fragrant, clean, juicy, complex, and also fuller-bodied, which is uncommon in most other fully washed coffees.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/kenya-karimikui-aa
Colombia - Finca Julia Anaerobic,"tamarind juice, cherry, passionfruit, chocolate",70.00,"Description Description Producer: Nicolas Ocampo Maya / Finca JuliaLocation: Trujillo, Valle del CaucaVariety: CastilloProcess: Natural Anaerobic & Anaerobic FermentationAltitude: 1,500 - 1,700 maslCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Specialty coffee production at the family-owned and operated farm and processing center, Finca La Julia in Trujillo, Valle De Cauca, started in 2015 with the initial cultivation of the Java variety and soon after, Tabi and Geisha. It is led by 2nd generation coffee growers, siblings Nicolas Ocampo Maya, who is hands-on at the farm as the head of operations and finance, and Karo Ocampo Maya, at the helm of strategy and communications. They re-established Finca La Julia to honor their father, the late Octavio, who was the first in their family to enter the world of coffee in the 1990s, with their mother, Angela. It was when tragedy struck, with Octavio suddenly passing away in 2002, that Niko truly began his journey as a coffee producer. Karo, who had then been based abroad, was compelled to move back to Colombia. Both took on the responsibility of expediently deepening their knowledge of coffee production and taking the reins of the family business, all the while consulting with their mother, Angela, They were then in their early 20s, simultaneously learning about coffee and running the farm. The wide array of varieties planted at the farm which have come to include traditional ones like Caturra, and hybrids Colombia and Castillo, thrive alongside native fruit trees that bear tropical fruits like guava, papaya, guanabana, and avocado, as well as citruses like orange, mandarin, and lemon. In 2006, they earned the Rainforest Alliance Certification, a testament to their earnest desire and commitment to preserve and protect the biodiversity of the natural environment cradling Finca La Julia while producing distinctive coffees. By striving to produce fine coffees with the best possible cup quality out of the diverse varieties they cultivate and innovative processing methods they implement, they wish for specialty coffee lovers to be able to indulge their senses and share their enjoyment with others while remembering to take care of nature. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The Castillo variety is a hybrid introduced by Colombia’s national coffee research institute, Cenicafe, in 2005 to mitigate the risk of debilitating productivity declines in the event of a coffee disease epidemic. It was developed as an improvement from the earlier released cultivars Colombia/F6 (circa 1982) and Tabi (Circa 2002) in terms of resilience, productivity, and cup quality. Generally, Castillo had been observed to cup as dominantly chocolatey and cherry-like with touches of citrus. Initially, there was skepticism regarding Castillo's cup quality compared to older varieties like Caturra. However, socially conscious and innovative producers conducted post-harvest processing experiments to demonstrate that the resilience and productivity of Castillo could coexist with good to exceptional cup quality. The success of these experiments opened numerous avenues for creating diverse and unique flavor profiles, providing opportunities for farmers to receive better recognition and rewards for their hard work. For this lot, only ripe cherries with sugar levels between 24 to 30 on the Brix scale were included in post-harvest processing. To achieve this, cherries were carefully selected and hand-collected by seasoned pickers. Once the cherries reached the processing center, they underwent flotation to ensure the dense cherries could be isolated and proceed to an additional sorting step on raised beds to remove unripe, underripe, and overripe cherries, before entering the dual-phased fermentation stage. Phase 1 involved putting the cherries in uncovered tanks within a shaded environment for 48 hours. Phase 2 involved sealing the tanks and allowing the fermentation to continue for another six days. The anaerobic phase facilitates the possibility to introduce flavors and aromas, like more aromatic and intensified fruit notes, which are considered uncommon, in cups of Castillo, as well as a more pleasing mouthfeel and body. At the end of fermentation, the cherries underwent a triple-phased drying protocol. First, they were laid out to drain on raised beds for three days, followed by another three to four days in a closely controlled mechanical drier). and then finally they were taken to the farm’s sun-drying station. In this third and last phase of drying, airflow and shade were controlled while temperature was maintained within 30-38°. The total drying duration would take between 20-25 days. As a result, this lot expresses a complex and intense yet harmonious quality, with ripe fruit sweetness and distinct tropicality enriched by chocolate undertones.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/colombia-finca-julia-anaerobic

They started the company with a noble sense of responsibility to contribute to nation-building by directly participating in advancing the country’s agricultural agenda, being its predominant source of both national income and pride. In so doing, EDN is among the enablers of bettering coffee-growing families’ welfare while helping introduce improvements and innovations to traditional know-how, thereby supporting efforts to perpetuate the country’s intangible heritage in coffee. Quality-focused and customer-oriented, the company has invested in nurturing its ties with peer producers and the smallholder farmers within their scope, skill-building within their teams, as well as building out the appropriate infrastructure to meet the requirements of its global customers. As such, they have been gaining renown for their professionalism and reliability as a provider of higher-end specialty coffees in small and difficult-to-acquire batches amid an increasingly challenging milieu. Washed, natural, honey, and anaerobic post-harvest processing methods are implemented across EDN’s processing sites located in two of only three eminent coffee-growing administrative regions recognized at the Ethiopian Cup of Excellence from 2021 to 2022, both in the south. First is SNNPR (i.e. the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region), where the neighboring Yirgacheffe and Gedeb districts within the Gedeo zone are located. Second is the Oromia Region, where the Hambela district within the Guji zone is. It is the Yirgacheffe Gedeb Processing Site that receives and processes the coffee cherries encapsulating the most desirable characteristics of the Gedeo highlands’ paramount terroir, situated at 1,950 to 2,300 masl, and which are cultivated and harvested by smallholder farmers from the Banko Gotiti Village — most of whom are still in the process of recovering their livelihoods and restoring their households after being displaced by intercommunal conflicts in the last half-decade. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Kurume is one of the varieties native to the Gedeo zone and reportedly originated from the Yirgacheffe. Collectively, coffee varieties that have naturally occurred and proliferated in Ethiopia are referred to as “regional landraces.” “Ethiopian heirloom,” meanwhile, is the general term commonly used to identify coffee originating from Ethiopia. It covers regional landraces and Jimma Agricultural Research Center (JARC) varieties, which were developed and released to improve the productivity and livelihood of smallholder coffee farmers and boost the country's coffee industry. JARC varieties are promoted and bred because of their good quality when grown at the recommended elevations, resistance to or tolerance of adverse elements, and adaptability to diverse environments. There are 40+ JARC varieties comprised mostly of pure line selections and a handful of hybrids. Ethiopian heirlooms are popularly observed to express archetypal fruity and floral qualities and a complex character. Cultivated by Banko Gotiti farmers in modest parcels of land near their homestead without the use of non-natural inputs, Kurume and such other heirlooms that grow in close proximity are considered to be “garden coffees” that are organic by default. The properly ripe cherries are carefully hand-picked by the farmers and delivered to conveniently located collection points, where flotation is done to spot and remove overripe, underripe, and damaged cherries. EDN employees then do a further visual assessment to ensure only the cherries at optimum ripeness proceed to the anaerobic fermentation phase, which ensues in pressurized and oxygen-free containers. Throughout fermentation, there is strict monitoring and control to ensure the necessary sugar content, temperature, and pressure levels are met and maintained, and oxygen is consistently absent, to achieve the desired cup profile. After 10 to 12 days in the anaerobic fermentation phase, the cherries are transferred from the fermentation tanks to the drying beds, which had been designed to allow for proper air circulation. Throughout the drying phase, which could last from 15 to 20 days until the target moisture level of 11% is reached, the cherries are periodically churned to achieve the required degree of fermentation. Had this micro-lot undergone a washed process, the flavor profile would have been directed towards heady florals and herbally tinged bright citruses. Through the natural anaerobic process, however, the cup’s character turned towards the heightened, fragrant, and sticky sweetness of tropical fruits balanced by a muted acidity.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-yirgacheffe-banko-gotiti

The move was a definite game-changer that gave them control over quality and the capacity to be creative to experiment and maximize the flavor potential of the coffees grown on their farm and their neighbors’. Brunca is one of the eight coffee-growing regions identified by the country’s national coffee institute, ICAFE. It is dubbed the last frontier in the ICAFE publication Cafe de Costa Rica: Spirit of a Nation because it is the most remote of all the eight. Within it, the Chirripó micro-region has been gaining renown as a specialty coffee origin due to its terroir. Located between the country’s two highest mountains, Cerro de la Muerte (3.491m.) and Cerro Chirripó (3.820m.), coffee farms in this area sit at high altitudes from 1300 to 2000 masl and benefit from the rich soils and biodiverse natural environment. All of these contribute to the unique microclimates that allow coffee trees to grow well and produce healthy cherries that capture the myriad flavors of the land. The remarkable quality of Chirripó coffee had been recognized at the Cup of Excellence, when a honey-processed Caturra produced by Café Rivense ranked 5th in the 2019 competition. This recognition encouraged an increase in land planted with coffee and the cultivation of different varieties in the Chirripó micro-region, which is projected to continue for years ahead. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The hybrid Catuai was introduced to the Brunca region during Costa Rica’s green revolution, along with the latest varieties and agricultural practices at the time. It was created to increase productivity and facilitate easier harvesting by cross-breeding the compact Caturra and the high-yielding Mundo Novo. The Ureña Rojas family’s focus on traceability through micro-lots enables innovation in post-harvest processing at Café Rivense. The micro-lot system allows them to identify and associate which particular varieties, such as Catuai, grown in which specific microclimates across the farm, express their best qualities when processed in a certain way. Since micro-lot information is shared when marketing their coffees, consumer feedback can be tied back to the micro-lot and support Café Rivense in learning about the market’s preferences and modifying aspects of their production accordingly. In this micro-lot, the cherries were selectively hand-picked at the peak of ripeness and processed without the use of water, whether in transit or during pulping.

In collaboration with Raul Rodas of Paradigma Coffee, Adolfo and Adolfito Jr. have been working to develop anaerobically processed lots. For this lot, fermentation was done in a shaded area, with the whole cherries kept in sealed tanks for a period of five days. Temperature was controlled in order not to exceed 35 degrees. Then, drying was done on African beds for fifteen days. Their objective was to cater to the customers’ current preference for intensely fruity and fuller-bodied coffees by bringing out these qualities in their Caturra.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/guatemala-finca-la-laguna-anaerobic

Ethiopia - Guji Uraga Haro Wolabu,"apricot, red grape, pear, caramel",50.00,"Description Description Producer: Oboleyan Coffee / Small Holder FarmersLocation: Uraga Haro, Wolabu VillageVariety: Mixed HeirloomProcess: NaturalAltitude: 2,100 - 2,300 maslCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Ethiopia and its coffee farming families stand to benefit more abundantly from the country's inherent advantages as the primordial origin of coffee —invariably blessed terroir; instinctual, indigenous know-how; and unmatched genetic diversity — once they overcome the various challenges faced by the coffee sector in terms of productivity and premium market access. Oboleyan Coffee Export PLC, with Tariku Edema at the helm as General Manager, was founded with his four brothers after the government relaxed regulations in 2018 and allowed private entities to increase their participation in the coffee industry. The Edema brothers were, and continue to be, driven by the calling to play a significant part in alleviating the living conditions of as many coffee farming families as their enterprise can reach. They established coffee processing centers, better known in Ethiopia as ""washing stations,"" in the Guji Zone of Oromia — one of the only three coffee-growing regions recognized by the Ethiopia Cup of Excellence, consecutively in 2021 and 2022 — to afford out-growers in the proximate districts a venue for processing their coffee cherries toward the level of quality acknowledged and rewarded within the specialty coffee world. This did not only open up opportunities for increasing the value of and material returns for the farming families' crops but also for augmenting their knowledge base, leading to better cultivation and harvesting practices that would lead to sustainably increased productivity alongside consistent quality. Haro Wolabu is a coffee farming community in the Uraga district and a close neighbor to Hambela. At elevations between 2,100 and 2,300 masl, the locale rests on fertile soils and receives an ideal amount of rainfall, which are among the beneficial factors contributing to the sought-after attributes of their coffee. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process “Mixed heirloom” is the general term commonly used to identify coffee originating from Ethiopia, encompassing regional landraces and Jimma Agricultural Research Center (JARC) varieties. JARC varieties are promoted and bred because of their good quality when grown at the recommended elevations, resistance to or tolerance of adverse elements, and adaptability to diverse environments. There are 40+ JARC varieties comprising mainly pure line selections and a handful of hybrids. They are known to express floral and fruity qualities, and a complex character even when processed using traditional methods. Following traditional practices, Haro Wolabu Village farmers cultivate several varieties in small plots of land without artificial inputs, making the coffees organic by default. Many of them depend on the natural proliferation of the coffee plants, which grow into trees close to each other, which in some cases can inhibit the identification of the individual coffee varieties at the time of harvest. At harvest season, the head of household designates the trees which are ripe for picking — the ones with deep red cherries — and it is conventionally women who are recognized to have the acumen for it who lead in this task. Throughout, they take care not to strip the trees of leaves or harm any of the branches. The cherries are then brought to Oboleyan Coffee’s washing station, where they are pre-cleaned and sorted before being laid out on the raised beds to dry. The critical challenge of natural processing lies in enabling only the desired flavors to develop in order for a high level of quality to be achieved. To do this, it is necessary for the lots to include only healthy, ripe cherries. Further, the cherries must dry evenly until the target moisture level is reached in a process that takes between 10 to 12 days. Facilitating both requires the keen attention and careful manual labor of the farmers who select and sort the cherries, and the washing station workers who monitor the moisture levels and carry out tasks like turning the cherries over at regular intervals and covering them with the appropriate material in case of unfavorable weather conditions. In this lot, the natural process revealed more of a caramel character rounded out by subtle fruit overtones.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-guji-uraga-haro-wolabu

Engaged in progressive processing techniques and farming practices respectful of nature, Jamison lets the most favorable, naturally occurring sensory nuances of a coffee shine on the palate. It’s a feat accomplished by few and evidently appreciated worldwide, as national and world coffee competitors frequently choose to showcase his coffees. 2016 saw his prowess shine brighter when Taiwan’s Berg Wu won the World Barista Championship using a Geisha from Finca Deborah. Since then, numerous national champions have entrusted Jamison to design coffees for their routines on the world stage. Among them are our very own WBrC representative David Disuanco and France's Charity Cheung. It was in the early 2000s when Jamison, at the height of his finance career in the US, decided a change was in order. He longed for a freer lifestyle to give himself and his family a chance to spend more time outdoors and to travel. At the same time, he was looking for a real estate asset to fill a gap in his investment portfolio. In our 2022 Producer’s Talk, Jamison shared that they were choosing between Panama and New Zealand. Panama eventually won out for practical reasons and the sheer beauty and promise of the land. Their deliberation and preparation took about five years and culminated in 2008, the year the Savage family uprooted and started anew on foreign soil. They made their new home in the Volcan region of the Chiriqui province, the seat of Panama Geisha cultivation and home to Finca Deborah, Iris Estate, and Savage Coffees. Savage Coffees is a collaboration between Jamison Savage and boutique coffee producers in the highlands of Boquete Valley and Volcan, Chiriqui — also known as Panama’s Valley of Flowers and Eternal Spring. The community’s heritage expertise is built on generations of deep commitment to quality and close attention to detail. Paired with years of disciplined experimentation, Savage Coffees have consistently delivered podium-finishing coffees reflecting the land's natural character. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The process for Parabolic started with harvesting perfectly ripe Geisha cherries, registering 21-24 on the BRIX meter. These cherries were twice sorted and selected before being deposited into hermetically sealed, stainless steel tanks, where they remained for upwards of 100 hours. During this period, CO2 was introduced at regular intervals amid a controlled and regulated fermentation environment. This was the time the coffee seeds could absorb high fruit notes and finer aromatics from the cherry itself. Temperature and PH were monitored throughout this duration, ensuring these variables stayed within pre-defined limits. Following their extended stay inside the sealed tanks, the cherries were removed and laid out on the three-tiered, raised African bed system designed by Jamison. Temperatures, humidity, and airflow were also maintained within specific parameters in the shaded drying areas, also referred to as dry houses, as the cherries were consistently and carefully shifted throughout the day for even drying. These steps were carried out to prevent undesired microbial activity from occurring and to promote the development only of desired flavors. The cherries spent around 20 days on the drying beds before reaching the proper moisture level of approximately 11%. To protect the quality that had painstakingly been created, they were then bagged in Grain-pro and stored under optimal conditions of cool and stable temperatures for a reposo or seasoning process critical in Jamison's stringent end-to-end QC protocol. In reposo, the coffee's moisture content stabilized while allowing it to keep absorbing more flavor from its parchment or shell, before being hulled and further sorted by size, density, and color, and finally shipped to us. About the Panama Geisha Panama Geisha, of which Green Tip Geisha is one variation, is a rare, delicate, and complex variety well-loved for its sweet florality and citrus highlights. Since its debut win at the Best of Panama auction in 2004, it has kept specialty coffee lovers everywhere captivated by its endless possibilities, delicacy, complexity, and clarity of flavors. As such, it is often showcased on coffee competition stages by a great number of coffee champions, and it also continues to fetch the highest prices. While a coffee’s truest intrinsic qualities are still largely believed to be showcased best by traditional washed processing due to the demucilaging, washing, and scrubbing steps removing all traces of fruit from the bean, the expertise of seasoned and passionate producers like Jamison Savage allows them to direct the flavor character of the Panama Geisha towards a seemingly endless diversity of delightfully surprising trajectories. They do this through the purposeful implementation of traditional methods like the natural and honey processes, as well as intentional and innovative processing styles, such as this Natural Carbonic Maceration process, which add to the complexity of the cup’s character — for example more layers of flavor or better mouthfeel — without compromising its inherent qualities from terroir and variety.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/panama-parabolic
Panama - Elida Geisha Natural Falda 1002,"mango, raspberry, apple, mandarine",305.00,"Description Description Producer: Lamastus Family EstatesLocation: Baru Volcano Boquete, PanamaVariety: GeishaProcess: NaturalAltitude: 1700 - 1950 MASLCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer The Lamastus Family Estates have accrued the most Best of Panama awards to date. They won the Producer of the Year Award in 2022, which followed their two peat victories in 2018 for the Washed Geisha category and in 2019 for both Washed and Natural. A coffee company founded in 1918 by Robert Lamastus, they have evolved with the times under the leadership of Robert's son Thatcher, grandson Wilford Sr., and great-grandson Wilford Jr. Their four farms are Elida, El Burro, Luito, and Lulo. Each one benefits from discrete microclimates which, together with variety, are primarily responsible for the intricacies and flavor potential of their coffees. Elida Estate is the foremost and flagship farm. It is also the company's headquarters, where the family spends most of their time and where Wilford Sr. would be found working every day. It was named as a tribute to the Lamastus family matriarch, Elida, who single-handedly raised her children and took charge of all farm operations after her husband Robert passed away in the early 1930s. It would take almost two decades before any of her children could assist. About half of Elida Estate is located within the Volcan Baru National Park, one of Central America’s highest volcanoes, which is also a protected ecological reserve and sanctuary for exotic flora and fauna. Among the Estate’s unique world conditions are: high elevation, volcanic soils, low temperatures, beneficial microorganisms, mist during the dry season, and virgin-native cloudy rain forest surrounding the coffee trees. The low night-time temperatures allow for protracted ripening of the coffee cherries, which help make them healthier and the resulting coffee beans sweeter. The Falda Lot within Elida Estate is a new lot located on a slope partially inside the Baru Volcano National Park, where the Geisha trees benefit from full sun exposure all day. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Recognizing they have been blessed with the ideal terroir, the Lamastus family profoundly believes their coffees are a gift from Mother Nature. Respectful of that, they favor innovations in drying techniques rather than experimenting with inoculation during fermentation. They also implement traditional methods such as the straightforward washed process. No matter the method, Lamastus Family Estates enforce strict protocols at every stage to achieve excellent quality consistently. No matter the method, Lamastus Family Estates enforce strict protocols at every stage to achieve excellent quality consistently.

"Colombia - Daniel, Finca El Paraiso","jasmine, orange blossom, papaya, honey",215.00,"Description Description Producer: Diego Samuel BermudezLocation: Piendamo, CaucaVariety: GeishaProcess: Thermal Shock NaturalAltitude: 1,960 maslCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Finca El Paraiso is the realization of one family’s dream of a coffee farm as a kind of paradise. It started to materialize in 2008 when Diego Samuel Bermudez and his family began to cultivate an assortment of traditional, novel, and exotic coffee varieties across the well-endowed and sky-reaching terrains of Vereda Los Arados, Tunía in the Piendamó municipality of the Cauca department in Colombia. It is their family’s flagship farm, spanning 49 hectares, and the headquarters of their trailblazing post-harvest processing company, INDESTEC S.A.S, shorthand for “Innovation and Technological Development for Agriculture.” This is their platform for ongoing research into and the promotion of precise and purposeful experimental methods and techniques, like the stirringly named “Thermal Shock,” intended to create a cornucopia of peerless cup profiles. Their aim — to distinguish Finca El Paraiso among the department and the nation’s accomplished and prolific producers, generate greater interest across global specialty coffee lovers, elevate the value of Cauca-grown coffees, and on the whole, contribute to continuously raising the profile and position of Colombia as an innovative and pre-eminent origin of higher-end specialty coffees. Finca El Paraiso’s location on the Pan-American route between Popayán, Cauca’s capital, and Cali, a municipality in the neighboring department Valle del Cauca, with a prevailing climate described as temperate-humid and the frequent incidence of winds from the Pacific, has been attributed for the tropical notes frequently perceived in their coffees. Meanwhile, Cauca is one of the 21 officially designated coffee-growing departments of Colombia, which was granted its “Denomination of Origin” in 2011 as a testament to the remarkable quality and distinct flavor identity of its coffees. Due to Colombia’s immense heterogeneity of microclimates, terroirs, varieties, and their resultant flavor characters, Colombia is regarded in the world of coffee as a “Land of Diversity.” When traditionally washed, Cauca coffees are generally characterized as clean, soft, and fragrant, with pronounced caramelized aromas and carrying flavors tending toward high acidity with discernible sweet and floral notes, a medium body, and a balanced overall impression. Amid this backdrop, Finca El Paraiso truly caught the specialty coffee world’s attention when Diego Samuel made it to the Top 10 of the 2018 Cup of Excellence with a double anaerobic Bourbon, and again counted among the 2019 winners with a washed anaerobic Castillo. Five years on from their first COE accolade and 15 years after Finca El Paraiso’s founding, the family emblem Finca Paraiso has come to encompass six more farms — Villa Rosita, Villa Alejandro, Villa Esperanza, Sur, El Rubi, and El Manizales — and their family’s dream continues to prosper while empowering the communities they work with to succeed. They do this through INDESTEC’s six action pillars — Technology, Knowledge Management, Collaboration, Sustainable Marketing, Resource Management, and Rural Alliances. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Geisha is the storied variety acclaimed for its delicate complexity and clarity of fruit and floral flavors. For this reason, it is frequently showcased by coffee champions in their competition routines. Acclimatized to the Cauca region, the Geisha has been perceived to be delicately citric, aromatic, fruity, and winey when fermented in cherry. Finca El Paraiso and INDESTEC's ingenuity lies in having thoroughly studied, implemented, and documented their simultaneously structured and creative processing methods and techniques at such a high level of granularity that allows for consistent repeatability of their approaches and effectively unconstrains their potential to increase the diversity of probable flavor profiles, depending on the customers' preferences, varieties on hand, and the prevailing terroir conditions at the time of processing. To consistently achieve the desired cup profiles, precision in configuring the different processing parameters at every significant phase is a hallmark of harvesting, sorting, fermentation, and drying at Finca El Paraiso. For our Daniel Geisha, overripe coffee cherries were deliberately collected due to the longer contact time between their pulp and coffee seeds, which would impart more fruit flavors to the coffee beans. The coffee cherries were then disinfected with ozone to remove extraneous microbiological load likely to misdirect the fermentation phase. Once cleaned, the cherries were transferred to stainless steel fermentation tanks for an initial inertization step where CO2 was injected, precluding oxygen and preventing the compounds in the coffee pulp from oxidizing. The generation of gases such as CO2 in the cherry marks the start of the anaerobic fermentation phase, as pressure gradually increased within the tanks and prompted the active transfer of fluids from the pulp to the seeds, while temperature was maintained at 18°C and pressure at 20 psi, for a period of 96 hours. Thermal Shock was applied by quickly turning up the temperature of the fermentation fluids, rapidly opening up the membranes and pores of the coffee beans and facilitating the attachment of the abundant aroma and flavor precursors in the fermentation medium to them, and immediately subjecting the cherries to a drastic drop in temperature, sealing the coffee beans’ pores, locking the aroma and flavor precursors in. As for the crucial drying phase, Finca El Paraiso’s custom drying and dehumidifying technology was used. It was designed with consideration to the usually highly volatile and thermolabile compounds generated during fermentation and genetically inherent in the coffees. As such, it removes moisture by mass transfer, allowing the drying phase to be accomplished without high temperatures, and thereby making way for a less abrupt transition to seed dormancy. This, in effect, permits the coffee to be stored for extended periods without the risk of presenting quality defects and guarantees the highest possible quality of the final green coffee.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/colombia-daniel-finca-el-paraiso

Kai and Jannette Janson, both from the second generation and Miguel, Janette’s son, are at the forefront. Their coffees have been awarded and auctioned several times at the Best of Panama, and are often featured by coffee champions on the world stage. 2023 has so far been a hallmark year for @kaijanson, @jannettejanson, and the rest of the Janson coffee family as they were part of that dream team who took home the top trophy at the 2023 World Barista Championship, with a Janson Geisha at the core of the winning routine, as well as podium finishers at the 2023 World Brewers Cup. At the Best of Panama 2023, Janson Geisha Natural ranked 3rd, while Geisha Washed placed 5th. Their family’s work in coffee began in the mid-1980s when the first generation realized their land’s potential for coffee cultivation after receiving advice from agricultural engineers. And it was in 1990 that Janson Coffee was officially established by Michael, Carl, Ricardo†, and Peter Janson. They were inspired by their father’s dedication to hard work, quality, and love for their land. Since the company’s founding, their vision has been to produce high-quality specialty coffee consumed and enjoyed in Panama and abroad. Their father was Carl Axel Janson, a Swedish immigrant who acquired and established the original Janson hacienda, a cattle farm, in 1941. As a family enterprise, they continue to be driven by the passion to produce excellent coffees while preserving their land and improving the quality of life of their collaborators and their respective families. Two coffee plantations, spanning 100 hectares combined, comprise Janson Coffee. Both are located on the Talamanca Mountain Range, on the inclines of the Tizingal and Baru volcanoes. Different varieties are cultivated on them — Catuai, Caturra, Pacamara, and Panama Geisha. Hacienda las Lagunas is in Tierras Altas, the High Lands District, in Volcan. Its name comes from the wetlands and lagoons in the vicinity. Located west of the Barú Volcano, Hacienda las Lagunas is rich in volcanic soil and has access to natural springs. Areas of natural reserve surround the different lots in the coffee farm and act as natural barriers. They also serve as essential habitats for a diversity of birds and wildlife. Meanwhile, Los Alpes, named after the Swiss Alps sits on the slopes of the Tizingal volcano, amid the Talamanca Mountain range in the westernmost part of Panama, northwest of the Barú Volcano and adjacent to the La Amistad International Park, which is a natural reserve and UNESCO World Heritage Site. This park crosses the Panamanian border into Costa Rica and shelters rich biodiversity, including the famous Quetzal bird. Raising the Energy Around Coffee At our February 2023 Producer’s Talk, when Kai shared his thoughts on how he sees specialty coffee evolving, we gained insight into the impetus for the innovations at Janson Coffee that result in the fascinating flavor profiles in our cup. What he said also lightly touched on the consumer's role in shaping the future of specialty coffee. He told us, ""It's an amazing ride — to see coffee grow and the energy around coffee… Our intention is, how do you create a coffee that is so fruity that you know it's a natural, and so powerful you know it's anaerobic, and so clean and gorgeous that it's like a classic washed — all in one cup, and at different points in the cup…if you're paying attention, you'll see that."" He also mentioned that brewing plays a large part in upholding quality. When we asked what's on the horizon for Janson Coffee, Kai shared that their goal is to keep raising the energy around coffee. We took this to mean: continuing to chase excellence in coffee quality and keeping everyone excited about it by creating genuine relationships and fun shared experiences with the coffee people they encounter. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The legendary Geisha variety is acclaimed for its sweet florality and bright overtones. Since its debut win at the Best of Panama auction in 2004, it has kept specialty coffee lovers everywhere captivated by its endless possibilities, delicacy, complexity, and clarity of flavors. As such, it is often showcased on coffee competition stages by a great number of coffee champions, and it also continues to fetch the highest prices. Throughout their 30+ year history, the Jansons have relied on the experience of their founders while remaining attentive to every step and fine-tuning areas of production, from cultivation to processing, that will allow them to produce increasingly more delicious coffees. To begin with, they maintain the balance of nutrients in the soil by preserving the endemic flora in their farms, which serve as natural barriers and obviate the need for pesticides or herbicides. Pickers are trained to select and hand-collect only the properly ripe cherries at harvest and to further re-assess the cherries in their baskets and remove any that do not conform. These are then carefully placed in plastic crates, and no longer in sacks, to be sent for processing. This change was done to remove the risk of the cherries being compressed, and losing juices and sugars beneficial to flavor development, while in transit to the beneficio or plant. Upon reaching the plant, the cherries are passed through a mechanical siphon to separate the denser cherries from the rest before going into fermentation. This is done since the highest potential for the best flavors rests within the healthiest cherries, typically indicated by a higher density. Alpes Panama Geisha Lot 136 underwent 48 hours of natural fermentation. Prior to the final drying phase, the cherries were first laid out on the patio for a couple of days to remove excess moisture. In the daytime, they were moved periodically to encourage even drying, and in the afternoon, the cherries were taken and kept in a warehouse to avoid getting wet and to allow for more sugar and flavors to be absorbed into the bean from the pulp. Finally, they were placed on raised beds to dry for 13 days resulting in a rounded, syrupy, juicy, and tart cup character.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/panama-janson-lot-136-geisha

The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The Castillo variety is a hybrid introduced by Colombia’s national coffee research institute, Cenicafe, in 2005 to mitigate the risk of debilitating productivity declines in the event of a coffee disease epidemic. It was developed as an improvement from the earlier released cultivars Colombia/F6 (circa 1982) and Tabi (Circa 2002) in terms of resilience, productivity, and cup quality. Generally, Castillo had been observed to cup as dominantly chocolatey and cherry-like with touches of citrus. For a time, there was a popular, unfavorable sentiment around Castillo's potential to cup well in comparison to older varieties like Caturra. It was in that context socially conscious and innovative producers like Diego Samuel Bermudez pursued post-harvest processing experiments intending to illustrate that the resilience and productivity of a hybrid variety like Castillo can go hand-in-hand with good, even exceptional, cup quality. This served to increase awareness among Colombian coffee farmers that they can reduce their risk of loss by planting disease-resistant varieties while remaining confident that their coffees can cup competitively and thus be valued at a premium. On top of that, their successful experiments would open up numerous trajectories for creating a diversity of unique flavor profiles, augmenting opportunities for the farmers to be better rewarded for their hard work. Finca El Paraiso and INDESTEC's ingenuity lies in having thoroughly studied, implemented, and documented their simultaneously structured and creative processing methods and techniques at such a high level of granularity that allows for consistent repeatability of their approaches and effectively unconstrains their potential to increase the diversity of probable flavor profiles, depending on the customers' preferences, varieties on hand, and the prevailing terroir conditions at the time of processing. To consistently achieve the desired cup profiles, precision in configuring the different processing parameters at every significant phase is a hallmark of harvesting, sorting, fermentation, and drying at Finca El Paraiso. In this micro-lot, coffee cherries were harvested at the optimum point of ripeness and then pre-cleaned and sorted by removing leaves, branches, and other impurities, followed by flotation to facilitate the selection of the most optimal cherries, and disinfection with ozone to remove extraneous microbiological load before proceeding to the 36-hour anaerobic fermentation phase, submerged in water. After fermentation, coffee was pulped and demucilaginated. Then, the pulp and mucilage were taken to the main processing plant and used to produce specific micro-organisms that would constitute the culture medium called “Yeast Yellow Fruits” containing the precursors of the desired aromas and flavors. The resultant culture medium was then added to the coffee for another 20 hours of fermentation, allowing the precursors to adhere to the coffee beans through pressure. To reinforce the adhesion of the aroma and flavor precursors to the beans, a Thermal Shock Washed technique was applied. Thermal Shock Washing was done by quickly turning up the temperature of the fermentation fluids to 40°C, rapidly opening up the membranes and pores of the coffee beans and facilitating the attachment of the abundant aroma and flavor precursors in the fermentation medium to them, and immediately following it with a wash using 12°C cold water to seal the coffee beans’ pores, locking the aroma and flavor precursors in. Otherwise, these precursors, such as the esters, aldehydes, organic acids, and alcohols produced by the metabolism of the earlier mentioned microorganisms as they consumed the coffee mucilage, would have remained in the leachate (i.e., not absorbed into the coffee bean), because the parchment and silver film covering the coffee beans are difficult to penetrate before Thermal Shock, and would then have wastefully just been washed off. As for the crucial drying phase, Finca El Paraiso’s custom drying and dehumidifying technology was used. It was designed with consideration to the usually highly volatile and thermolabile compounds generated during fermentation and genetically inherent in the coffees. As such, it removes moisture by mass transfer, allowing the drying phase to be accomplished without high temperatures, and thereby making way for a less abrupt transition to seed dormancy. This, in effect, permits the coffee to be stored for extended periods without the risk of presenting quality defects and guarantees the highest possible quality of the final green coffee.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/colombia-r03-rose-tea-finca-el-paraiso
"Colombia - Villa Rosita Red, Finca El Paraiso","lychee, strawberry, white peach, honeysuckle",65.00,"Description Description Producer: Diego Samuel BermudezLocation: Piendamó, Cauca Variety: Castillo, F6Process: Thermal Shock NaturalAltitude: 1960 MASLCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Finca El Paraiso is the realization of one family’s dream of a coffee farm as a kind of paradise. It started to materialize in 2008 when Diego Samuel Bermudez and his family began to cultivate an assortment of traditional, novel, and exotic coffee varieties across the well-endowed and sky-reaching terrains of Vereda Los Arados, Tunía in the Piendamó municipality of the Cauca department in Colombia. It is their family’s flagship farm, spanning 49 hectares, and the headquarters of their trailblazing post-harvest processing company, INDESTEC S.A.S, shorthand for “Innovation and Technological Development for Agriculture.” This is their platform for ongoing research into and the promotion of precise and purposeful experimental methods and techniques, like the stirringly named “Thermal Shock,” intended to create a cornucopia of peerless cup profiles. Their aim — to distinguish Finca El Paraiso among the department and the nation’s accomplished and prolific producers, generate greater interest across global specialty coffee lovers, elevate the value of Cauca-grown coffees, and on the whole, contribute to continuously raising the profile and position of Colombia as an innovative and pre-eminent origin of higher-end specialty coffees. Finca El Paraiso’s location on the Pan-American route between Popayán, Cauca’s, capital and Cali, a municipality in the neighboring department Valle del Cauca, with a prevailing climate described as temperate-humid and the frequent incidence of winds from the Pacific, has been attributed for the tropical notes frequently perceived in their coffees. Meanwhile, Cauca is one of the 21 officially designated coffee-growing departments of Colombia, which was granted its “Denomination of Origin” in 2011 as a testament to the remarkable quality and distinct flavor identity of its coffees. Due to Colombia’s immense heterogeneity of microclimates, terroirs, varieties, and their resultant flavor characters, Colombia is regarded in the world of coffee as a “Land of Diversity.” When traditionally washed, Cauca coffees are generally characterized as clean, soft, and fragrant, with pronounced caramelized aromas and carrying flavors tending toward high acidity with discernible sweet and floral notes, a medium body, and a balanced overall impression. Amid this backdrop, Finca El Paraiso truly caught the specialty coffee world’s attention when Diego Samuel made it to the Top 10 of the 2018 Cup of Excellence with a double anaerobic Bourbon, and again counted among the 2019 winners with a washed anaerobic Castillo. Five years on from their first COE accolade and 15 years after Finca El Paraiso’s founding, the family emblem Finca Paraiso has come to encompass six more farms — Villa Rosita, Villa Alejandro, Villa Esperanza, Sur, El Rubi, and El Manizales — and their family’s dream continues to prosper while empowering the communities they work with to succeed. They do this through INDESTEC’s six action pillars — Technology, Knowledge Management, Collaboration, Sustainable Marketing, Resource Management, and Rural Alliances. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Castillo and F6 are cultivars introduced by Colombia’s national coffee research institute, Cenicafe, to mitigate the risk of debilitating productivity declines in the event of a coffee disease epidemic. F6, also known as Colombia, comes from generations of mixing Catimors. It was released in the early 1980s and has been more known for its resistance to leaf rust than its cup quality. Castillo, meanwhile, was developed as an improvement from F6 and another cultivar, Tabi (circa 2002), in terms of resilience, productivity, and cup quality. Generally, Castillo had been observed to cup as dominantly chocolatey and cherry-like with touches of citrus. For a time, there was a popular, unfavorable sentiment around hybrids’ potential to cup well in comparison to older varieties like Caturra. It was in that context socially conscious and innovative producers like Diego Samuel Bermudez pursued post-harvest processing experiments intending to illustrate that the resilience and productivity of hybrid varieties like F6 and Castillo can go hand-in-hand with good, even exceptional, cup quality. This served to increase awareness among Colombian coffee farmers that they can reduce their risk of loss by planting disease-resistant varieties while remaining confident that their coffees can cup competitively and thus be valued at a premium. On top of that, their successful experiments would open up numerous trajectories for creating a diversity of unique flavor profiles, augmenting opportunities for the farmers to be better rewarded for their hard work. Finca El Paraiso and INDESTEC's ingenuity lies in having thoroughly studied, implemented, and documented their simultaneously structured and creative processing methods and techniques at such a high level of granularity that allows for consistent repeatability of their approaches and effectively unconstrains their potential to increase the diversity of probable flavor profiles, depending on the customers' preferences, varieties on hand, and the prevailing terroir conditions at the time of processing. To consistently achieve the desired cup profiles, precision in configuring the different processing parameters at every significant phase is a hallmark of harvesting, sorting, fermentation, and drying at Finca El Paraiso. For Villa Rosita Red, overripe coffee cherries were deliberately collected due to the longer contact time between their pulp and coffee seeds, which would impart more fruit flavors to the coffee beans. The coffee cherries were then disinfected with ozone to remove extraneous microbiological load likely to misdirect the fermentation phase. Once cleaned, the cherries were transferred to stainless steel fermentation tanks for an initial inertization step where CO2 was injected, precluding oxygen and preventing the compounds in the coffee pulp from oxidizing. The generation of gases such as CO2 in the cherry marked the start of the anaerobic fermentation phase, as pressure gradually increased within the tanks and prompted the active transfer of fluids from the pulp to the seeds, while temperature was maintained at 18°C and pressure at 20 psi, for a period of 96 hours. To intensify the desired fruity attributes, the “Red Fruits Yeast” culture (from El Paraiso’s extensive library) was added to the cherries and pressure was increased to 30 psi to encourage greater adhesion of the aroma and flavor precursors created during fermentation to the coffee beans. Thermal Shock was applied by quickly turning up the temperature of the fermentation fluids, rapidly opening up the membranes and pores of the coffee beans and facilitating the attachment of the abundant aroma and flavor precursors in the fermentation medium to them, and immediately subjecting the cherries to a drastic drop in temperature, sealing the coffee beans’ pores, locking the aroma and flavor precursors in. As for the crucial drying phase, Finca El Paraiso’s custom drying and dehumidifying technology was used. It was designed with consideration to the usually highly volatile and thermolabile compounds generated during fermentation and genetically inherent in the coffees. As such, it removes moisture by mass transfer, allowing the drying phase to be accomplished without high temperatures, making way for a less abrupt transition to seed dormancy.

Kai and Jannette Janson, both from the second generation and Miguel, Janette’s son, are at the forefront. Their coffees have been awarded and auctioned several times at the Best of Panama, and are often featured by coffee champions on the world stage. 2023 has so far been a hallmark year for @kaijanson, @jannettejanson, and the rest of the Janson coffee family as they were part of that dream team who took home the top trophy at the 2023 World Barista Championship, with a Janson Geisha at the core of the winning routine, as well as podium finishers at the 2023 World Brewers Cup. At the Best of Panama 2023, Janson Geisha Natural ranked 3rd, while Geisha Washed placed 5th. Their family’s work in coffee began in the mid-1980s when the first generation realized their land’s potential for coffee cultivation after receiving advice from agricultural engineers. And it was in 1990 that Janson Coffee was officially established by Michael, Carl, Ricardo†, and Peter Janson. They were inspired by their father’s dedication to hard work, quality, and love for their land. Since the company’s founding, their vision has been to produce high-quality specialty coffee consumed and enjoyed in Panama and abroad. Their father was Carl Axel Janson, a Swedish immigrant who acquired and established the original Janson hacienda, a cattle farm, in 1941. As a family enterprise, they continue to be driven by the passion to produce excellent coffees while preserving their land and improving the quality of life of their collaborators and their respective families. Two coffee plantations, spanning 100 hectares combined, comprise Janson Coffee. Both are located on the Talamanca Mountain Range, on the inclines of the Tizingal and Baru volcanoes. Different varieties are cultivated on them — Catuai, Caturra, Pacamara, and Panama Geisha. Hacienda las Lagunas is in Tierras Altas, the High Lands District, in Volcan. Its name comes from the wetlands and lagoons in the vicinity. Located west of the Barú Volcano, Hacienda las Lagunas is rich in volcanic soil and has access to natural springs. Areas of natural reserve surround the different lots in the coffee farm and act as natural barriers. They also serve as essential habitats for a diversity of birds and wildlife. Meanwhile, Los Alpes, named after the Swiss Alps sits on the slopes of the Tizingal volcano, amid the Talamanca Mountain range in the westernmost part of Panama, northwest of the Barú Volcano and adjacent to the La Amistad International Park, which is a natural reserve and UNESCO World Heritage Site. This park crosses the Panamanian border into Costa Rica and shelters rich biodiversity, including the famous Quetzal bird. Raising the Energy Around Coffee At our February 2023 Producer’s Talk, when Kai shared his thoughts on how he sees specialty coffee evolving, we gained insight into the impetus for the innovations at Janson Coffee that result in the fascinating flavor profiles in our cup. What he said also lightly touched on the consumer's role in shaping the future of specialty coffee. He told us, ""It's an amazing ride — to see coffee grow and the energy around coffee… Our intention is, how do you create a coffee that is so fruity that you know it's a natural, and so powerful you know it's anaerobic, and so clean and gorgeous that it's like a classic washed — all in one cup, and at different points in the cup…if you're paying attention, you'll see that."" He also mentioned that brewing plays a large part in upholding quality. When we asked what's on the horizon for Janson Coffee, Kai shared that their goal is to keep raising the energy around coffee. We took this to mean: continuing to chase excellence in coffee quality and keeping everyone excited about it by creating genuine relationships and fun shared experiences with the coffee people they encounter. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The legendary Geisha variety is acclaimed for its sweet florality and bright overtones. Since its debut win at the Best of Panama auction in 2004, it has kept specialty coffee lovers everywhere captivated by its endless possibilities, delicacy, complexity, and clarity of flavors. As such, it is often showcased on coffee competition stages by a great number of coffee champions, and it also continues to fetch the highest prices. Throughout their 30+ year history, the Jansons have relied on the experience of their founders while remaining attentive to every step and fine-tuning areas of production, from cultivation to processing, that will allow them to produce increasingly more delicious coffees. To begin with, they maintain the balance of nutrients in the soil by preserving the endemic flora in their farms, which serve as natural barriers and obviate the need for pesticides or herbicides. Pickers are trained to select and hand-collect only the properly ripe cherries at harvest, and to further re-assess the cherries in their baskets and remove any that do not conform. These are then carefully placed in plastic crates, and no longer in sacks, to be sent for processing. This change was done to remove the risk of the cherries being compressed, and losing juices and sugars beneficial to flavor development, while in transit to the beneficio or plant. Upon reaching the plant, the cherries are passed through a mechanical siphon to separate the denser cherries from the rest before going into fermentation. This is done since the highest potential for the best flavors rests within the healthiest cherries, typically indicated by a higher density. Alpes Panama Geisha Lot 136 underwent 48 hours of natural fermentation. Prior to the final drying phase, the cherries were first laid out on the patio for a couple of days to remove excess moisture.

Colombia - Finca El Topacio Tabi,"brown sugar, raisin, apple, walnut",50.00,"Description Description Producer: Carlos Alberto Amariles / COFINETLocation: Genova, QuindioVariety: TabiProcess: Washed AnerobicAltitude: 1,900 - 2,000 maslCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Cofinet was established by brothers Carlos and Felipe Arcila, whose family history in coffee spans over 80 years. Their dedication to producing and distributing finer Colombian coffees has earned them a reputation as one of the world's renowned, larger-scale coffee distributors. Their long-running success is due to a steadfast commitment to quality and deep concern for and connections with the coffee growers they work with. The family's willingness to embrace innovative post-harvest processing approaches alongside time-tested methods has allowed them to explore new flavor trajectories not previously found in the Colombian coffee landscape. They ventured into innovative processing upon recognizing the benefit of alternative fermentation styles and keener attention to drying parameters in getting coffees to express novel and interesting tasting notes. Their application of such techniques on traditional and exotic varieties as well as relatively recent, resilient cultivars like Castillo, have been achieving the desired balance between productivity and cup quality. The Cofinet commitment to quality, sustainability, and ethical practices that allows them to produce great coffee goes hand in hand with their dedication to improving the lives of the people in communities where the coffees are grown is a key reason they enjoy high regard in the industry. As a family-owned business, their legacy — from the earliest days of sourcing and locally distributing coffee to local exporters until their operations' recent expansion encompassing global distribution — has always been driven by their passion for advancing the Colombian coffee industry within the global market and along with that uplift the quality of life of the coffee-farming families they work with. Carlos Alberto Amariles is a coffee grower whose farm, Finca El Topacio, is situated in Genova, the highest point of Quindío, the traditional center of Colombian coffee production. At 1900 to 2000 masl, his coffee trees thrive in the ideal microclimate and produce healthy cherries that contain the optimal components of flavor which are then revealed through thoughtful post-harvest processing. By using alternative methods for two years and counting, he has been able to realize the flavor and quality potential of the cultivars Castillo and Tabi grown on his farm for two years and counting. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Tabi is a cultivar developed by Cenicafe, Colombia's National Coffee Research Center as part of efforts aimed at creating a variety that would exhibit resilience, productivity, and the potential for good cup quality. It is a hybrid resulting from the crossbreeding of Typica, Bourbon, and Timor Hybrid. The Typica variety is known for its bright acidity and fruity notes, Bourbon for its sweet and nutty flavor, and Timor for its earthy and spicy notes. Having those three in its parentage, Tabi is observed to display a balance of boldness, acidity, and sweetness, alongside the Timor Hybrid’s resistance and adaptability. For this lot, the properly ripe Tabi cherries were selectively picked, and then floated and sorted to ensure only good quality cherries would proceed to the meticulously monitored and implemented 72-hour dry anaerobic fermentation phase using Grainpro bags. Throughout this stage, CO2 was periodically added into the bags to maintain an oxygen-free fermentation environment intended to enhance the coffee’s sweetness, mouthfeel, and body. The drying phase that followed was carried out on raised beds, at an ambient temperature of 35 degrees, until the desired moisture level was achieved. As a result, the character of Carlos’ Tabi expresses a comfortable and pleasant balance of caramelly and nutty nuances complemented by delicate acidity.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/colombia-finca-el-topacio-tabi
Costa Rica - Jaules,"black cherry, blueberry, guava, sweet candy",60.00,"Description Description Producer: Café Rivense del Chirripó / Ureña Rojas FamilyLocation: ChirripoVariety: CaturraProcess: NaturalAltitude: 1,500 – 1,700 maslCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer The pioneering Ureña Rojas family of Café Rivense del Chirripó, led by Régulo Ureña and Isabel Rojas, broke away from the country's commercially driven mega-mill processing model in the early 2000s when they built the first micro-mill in the Upper Buenavista Catchment in the Brunca region of South Costa Rica. The move was a definite game-changer that gave them control over quality and the capacity to be creative to experiment and maximize the flavor potential of the coffees grown on their farm and their neighbors’. Brunca is one of the eight coffee-growing regions identified by the country’s national coffee institute, ICAFE. It is dubbed the last frontier in the ICAFE publication Cafe de Costa Rica: Spirit of a Nation because it is the most remote of all the eight. Within it, the Chirripó micro-region has been gaining renown as a specialty coffee origin due to its terroir. Located between the country’s two highest mountains, Cerro de la Muerte (3.491m.) and Cerro Chirripó (3.820m.), coffee farms in this area sit at high altitudes from 1300 to 2000 masl and benefit from the rich soils and biodiverse natural environment. All of these contribute to the unique microclimates that allow coffee trees to grow well and produce healthy cherries that capture the myriad flavors of the land. The remarkable quality of Chirripó coffee had been recognized at the Cup of Excellence, with a Café Rivense honey-processed Caturra ranking 5th in the 2019 competition. This recognition encouraged an increase in land planted with coffee and the cultivation of different varieties in the Chirripó micro-region, which is projected to continue for years ahead. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Caturra was introduced to the Brunca region during Costa Rica’s green revolution, along with the latest varieties and agricultural practices at the time. It is a variety that naturally mutated from Bourbon and is generally known for its wide-ranging flavor potential spanning bright citruses to dark fruit, caramel, and chocolate. The Ureña Rojas family’s focus on traceability through micro-lots enables innovation in post-harvest processing at Café Rivense. The micro-lot system allows them to identify and associate which particular varieties, such as Catuai, grown in which specific microclimates across the farm, express their best qualities when processed in a certain way. Since micro-lot information is shared when marketing their coffees, consumer feedback can be tied back to the micro-lot and support Café Rivense in learning about the market’s preferences and modifying aspects of their production accordingly. Through a natural, extended fermentation process, this Café Rivense Caturra was made to exhibit candy-like sweetness complementing its complex acidity.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/costa-rica-jaules-cafe-rivense

Their coffees are grown at an average altitude of 1350 masl alongside shade-giving cypress, liquidambar, and lamcinca trees. The loamy and clayey soil, which is rich in nutrients, allows the banana, plantain, and citrus trees planted by the farmers for additional shade, to thrive alongside the coffee plants. The variety of flora in these areas adds a particular character to their crops. The Exporter CAFESMO is a collective of 250+ smallholder farmers based in the Honduran coffee-growing region close to Guatemala and El Salvador. Their coffee farms are bordered by the country’s highest peaks, Cerro Pital in the west, and the Guisayote National Reserve and the Pacayita volcano on the other side. The mountainous topography creates micro-climates beneficial to different coffees, such as Parainema, Pacas, Lempira, Catuaí, Obatá, Colombia, and IHCAFE90. Their members’ harvests are processed in their own centralized facility, which has a wet mill, drying patios, a dry mill, and a cupping lab. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The Parainema variety is a hybrid bred for its resistance to coffee rust disease and nematodes. Previously more recognized for its resilience and yield productivity, it has been gaining more attention for good cup quality. Its commendable flavor potential was confirmed when it won in the 2017 Honduran Cup of Excellence. The ripest cherries from the individual farmers are sorted for quality and uniformity, then processed at the CAFESMO facility. The cherries are then laid out to dry on the patio and regularly agitated for even drying, until the needed humidity level is achieved. This phase may take 20 to 30 days. Care is taken to safeguard the quality and marketability of the coffee, to avoid instances of the beans breaking if they get too dry or spoiling if they stay too moist.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/honduras-limoncello-lot-38

Rwanda - Fugi Intango,"ripe banana, dark cherry, mixed berries, caramel",60.00,"Description Description Producer: Baho Coffee / Emmanuel RusatiraLocation: Nyaruguru DistrictVariety: Red BourbonProcess: Natural AnaerobicAltitude: 1500 - 1870 MASLCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Emmanuel Rusatira founded Baho Coffee, intending to help to improve the livelihood of small coffee farmers in Rwanda. His empathy for their life struggles stems from having been born into a smallholding coffee-farming family himself. He came to a deeper understanding of the material challenges they face throughout his years directly working with them as a coffee washing station manager and realized the true extent of their plight when he oversaw upwards of 30 washing stations across the country, when he was working as a Department Head of Specialty Coffee, Sustainability, and Certification. The foundations for a quality-focused coffee industry established by the Rwandese government to revive the nation after the 1994 genocide —where Emmanuel lost his parents and brother — served not only as a source of hope for survivors like him but also as the fertile ground upon which they could rebuild their lives. Emmanuel decided that the evocative Rwandese word ""baho,"" literally meaning ""have life,"" best captures and conveys his company's reason for being — which is for his smallholding coffee farmer partners to have better lives. 950 smallholder farmers bring their cherries to the Fugi Washing Station in the Southwestern Province of Rwanda, between the Nyungwe National Forest and the country’s border with Burundi. It is solely dedicated to producing specialty coffee and has gained a reputation for unmatched micro-lots resulting from the combination of favorable climatic conditions, nutrient-balanced soils, appropriate farming practices, and purposeful post-harvest processing. The farmers are recognized and rewarded by Baho Coffee for cultivating high-quality cherries and delivering these to the washing station by way of premium prices and a second, bonus payment. Emmanuel also helps their community by providing health insurance and extending financial support for the children’s school-related expenses. This is another way Baho reassures each farmer that all their efforts to contribute to the company’s growth directly benefit them and their families as well. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Bourbon is the only variety that made it to the Cup of Excellence the last time the auction was conducted in Rwanda. This points to Bourbon’s propensity for taking in the best qualities of terroir, which then translate into desirable qualities in the cup. Amid a dominantly washed process-oriented industry, Emmanuel sought to be one of the pioneers of natural and honey processing in Rwanda after visiting Costa Rica, where he witnessed how these methods could multiply the trajectories of flavor creation. He applied this learning in Baho to widen their coffees’ range of flavors beyond the usual associations with the bold brightness of classic Kenyans and hints of Ethiopian florality. For this micro-lot, through the natural anaerobic process, Emmanuel’s team could direct flavors towards a rich, brown sugar-laden character balanced with acidity like in ripe and dark fruits. At Baho Coffee, the initial steps to process cherries are standardized. It starts with a day of intensive sorting in complete shade, to ensure only the ripest of cherries picked not more than 2 to 3 hours prior, and without any visible defects, proceed to the next steps. The sorted cherries are then floated in a large container, whereby floaters are removed, and only the densest ones are taken into processing as higher-grade lots. In this case, the densest cherries were fermented in sealed containers to tone down acidity and intensify sweetness. Then, they were placed on drying beds within a custom-built parabolic drying facility, akin to a greenhouse, to protect them from rain and too much sunlight. This drying phase can last from 50 to 55 days. During this period, the cherries are layered singly with a maximum depth of 2 to 4 cm and turned hourly for the first five days, and then every two hours until day 20. The ambient temperature and that of the coffee are closely monitored to control the pace of drying with the intention of keeping it slow. By recording temperature and moisture at regular intervals daily, the processing team can adjust their activities accordingly, whenever key drying indicators fall outside the target thresholds. For example, workers might shift the cherries more frequently or cover them with a mesh, or both, to prevent over-fermentation and the formation of molds, which would otherwise turn up in the cup as undesirable flavors indicative of defects. The drying phase ends upon reaching a moisture content of 11%, at which point the coffee in dried cherry is packed and kept in a dry warehouse until it needs to be milled.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/rwanda-fugi-intango

This leads to an increase in their crops' quality and market value. They also proactively connect with international specialty coffee roasters to match their own and their partners' coffees with the appropriate consumers. Through these connections, they enable the two ends of the coffee value chain to get the fullest benefit. Argemiro Hernandez of La Esperanza farm is one of Elias and Shady’s partners. He cultivates exotic varieties like Geisha, Wush Wush, and Java in his farm, which is located on the Conbeima Canyon, near Tolima’s capital Ibague. He is focused on producing nano-lots for every variety. In consultation with the Bayter brothers, he has assimilated alternative processing techniques into his protocols resulting in differentiated cup profiles. During the Ibague Cafe Festival in November 2022, his Wush Wush micro-lot qualified him as one of the ten top producers in Tolima. The Exporter Forest Coffee is a platform established by Elias and Shady Bayter for their local farming communities to share best practices, and for their coffee to gain world recognition and better benefit from the international market. They celebrate the time-honored Colombian tradition of producing high-quality coffee by fusing legacy knowledge with innovative techniques. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The infrequent availability of Wush Wush in very small batches has given it an air of mystery and built a sense of ongoing anticipation among specialty coffee lovers. What is known is that this variety originated from an eponymous town in Ethiopia famed for its tea estates, and then found its way to coffee-growing countries in Latin America, such as Panama and Colombia. The Wush Wush cup profile is reputed to have Geisha-like qualities and complexity, but with potential for a broader flavor spectrum, intensified sweetness, and a more viscous body. In their collaboration, the Bayter brothers and Argemiro used a washed anaerobic process for this nano-lot. Cherry was pre-fermented for 24 hours in Grain Pro bags, and then proceeded to submerged anaerobic fermentation in mucilage for another 48 hours. Drying was done for 8-12 hours daily for a period of 25 days. It resulted in pronounced florality with a nuanced acidity.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/colombia-wush-wush-la-esperanza
Ethiopia - Arsi Nansebo,"peach, tropical fruit, well-balanced, earl grey finish",50.00,"Description Description Producer: Tamiru Tadesse / Alo CoffeeLocation: Arsi NanseboVariety: 74158, 74112, 74110Process: NaturalAltitude: 2,160-2,280 maslCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Only a year into establishing Alo Coffee Export Plc, Tamiru Tadesse had already managed to foster a commendable reputation among specialty coffee connoisseurs around the world, with a burgeoning client base across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In 2021 Tamiru won 1st Place at the Ethiopia Cup of Excellence & advanced closer toward his goal of bringing greater recognition and rewards to Sidama Bensa coffee farmers, whose hard work and dedication make top-quality coffees possible. Six years working in coffee, Sidama Bensa-born Tamiru saw the great disconnect between the exceptional flavors and high cup quality potential of his hometown and neighboring districts’ coffees, and the way these were being undervalued across the market. It was also too clear to him how this put the smallholder coffee-growing families and the country's coffee industry at a huge disadvantage. A friend of Tamiru winning the 2020 Ethiopia Cup of Excellence inspired him to personally contribute to a solution by starting his company, Alo Coffee. Through Alo Coffee, he is able to provide the means for smallholders to process their laboriously cultivated, inherently organic, and flavor-rich coffee cherries into distinctive lots of the highest quality, and then match them with the specialty coffee communities that recognize their value and properly reward it. Arsi Nensebo is a coffee-growing district in the Oromia region adjacent to Sidama, in Ethiopia’s south. Its smallholder coffee farmers’ main source of livelihood are the fertile lands granted by the government, each spanning about 1-2 hectares, where they also grow food crops like maize and false banana. Rural families are allocated these farms by the government, which they rely on as their primary source of income and food. Across generations, stewardship of these lands becomes increasingly communal as they are typically subdivided among inheritors. On their own, each family and the community do not have the most current knowhow and sufficient resources to increase the yield of their harvests, nor to preserve and enhance the quality of the soils as well as that of their coffee cherries post-harvest. The involvement of quality-oriented and eco-socially committed specialty coffee producers like Alo Coffee contributes to alleviating the livelihood of the coffee-farming families, such as in Arsi Nensebo. To immediately benefit the smallholder coffee growers, Alo Coffee purchases their coffee cherries at a significant premium that provides a decent income to cover household essentials and their children’s education-related expenses. With a view for the longer term, Alo Coffee also provides direct assistance to the smallholder farmers through knowledge-sharing around improved practices in agronomy, cultivation, farm maintenance, and harvesting, while sponsoring community development projects such as building schools in the communities within their scope. Further, by taking charge of post-harvest processing, Alo Coffee unburdens the smallholders of the related risks and costs, enabling them to focus their attention and energy on maintaining the natural, unblemished condition of the land and looking after their coffee trees to ensure they flourish. By association with Tamiru and Alo Coffee, coffee-growing communities such as in Arsi Nensebo also have a better chance of their concerns and interests being acknowledged, advanced, and addressed by influential stakeholders across the industry. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process ‘Ethiopian heirloom’ is the general term commonly used to identify coffee originating from Ethiopia. It covers two classifications: Jimma Agricultural Research Center (JARC) varieties and regional landrace varieties. JARC varieties were developed and released to improve the productivity and livelihood of smallholder coffee farmers and boost the country's coffee industry. They are promoted and bred because of their good quality when grown at the recommended elevations, resistance to or tolerance of adverse elements, and adaptability to diverse environments. There are 40+ JARC varieties comprised mostly of pure line selections and a handful of hybrids. Regional landraces, meanwhile, are varieties that propagate in the wild, without regulated interventions. 74158, 74110, and 74112 are JARC varieties whose combined flavor potential we have grown familiar with in our years of sourcing and roasting coffees from the Ethiopia’s southern coffee-growing regions. Natural-processed, this lot from Arsi Nensebo expresses a well-balanced cup with stone fruit and tropical fruit character, with distinct citrus aromatics and a pleasantly brisk, tea-like quality.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-arsi-nansebo
"Colombia - M03, Finca El Paraiso","kitkat, lotus biscoff, honey chocolate",115.00,"Description Description Producer: Diego Samuel BermudezLocation: Piendamo, CaucaVariety: CastilloProcess: Thermal Shock WashedAltitude: 1,960 maslCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Finca El Paraiso is the realization of one family’s dream of a coffee farm as a kind of paradise. It started to materialize in 2008 when Diego Samuel Bermudez and his family began to cultivate an assortment of traditional, novel, and exotic coffee varieties across the well-endowed and sky-reaching terrains of Vereda Los Arados, Tunía in the Piendamó municipality of the Cauca department in Colombia. It is their family’s flagship farm, spanning 49 hectares, and the headquarters of their trailblazing post-harvest processing company, INVESTEC S.A.S, shorthand for “Innovation and Technological Development for Agriculture.” This is their platform for ongoing research into and the promotion of precise and purposeful experimental methods and techniques, like the stirringly named “Thermal Shock,” intended to create a cornucopia of peerless cup profiles. Their aim — to distinguish Finca El Paraiso among the department and the nation’s accomplished and prolific producers, generate greater interest across global specialty coffee lovers, elevate the value of Cauca-grown coffees, and on the whole, contribute to continuously raising the profile and position of Colombia as an innovative and pre-eminent origin of higher-end specialty coffees. Finca El Paraiso’s location on the Pan-American route between Popayán, Cauca’s capital, and Cali, a municipality in the neighboring department Valle del Cauca, with a prevailing climate described as temperate-humid and the frequent incidence of winds from the Pacific, has been attributed for the tropical notes frequently perceived in their coffees. Meanwhile, Cauca is one of the 21 officially designated coffee-growing departments of Colombia, which was granted its “Denomination of Origin” in 2011 as a testament to the remarkable quality and distinct flavor identity of its coffees. Due to Colombia’s immense heterogeneity of microclimates, terroirs, varieties, and their resultant flavor characters, Colombia is regarded in the world of coffee as a “Land of Diversity.” When traditionally washed, Cauca coffees are generally characterized as clean, soft, and fragrant, with pronounced caramelized aromas and carrying flavors tending toward high acidity with discernible sweet and floral notes, a medium body, and a balanced overall impression. Amid this backdrop, Finca El Paraiso truly caught the specialty coffee world’s attention when Diego Samuel made it to the Top 10 of the 2018 Cup of Excellence with a double anaerobic Bourbon and again counted among the 2019 winners with a washed anaerobic Castillo. Five years on from their first COE accolade and 15 years after Finca El Paraiso’s founding, the family emblem Finca Paraiso has come to encompass six more farms — Villa Rosita, Villa Alejandro, Villa Esperanza, Sur, El Rubi, and El Manizales — and their family’s dream continues to prosper while empowering the communities they work with to succeed. They do this through INDESTEC’s six action pillars — Technology, Knowledge Management, Collaboration, Sustainable Marketing, Resource Management, and Rural Alliances. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The Castillo variety is a hybrid introduced by Colombia’s national coffee research institute, Cenicafe, in 2005 to mitigate the risk of debilitating productivity declines in the event of a coffee disease epidemic. It was developed as an improvement from the earlier released cultivars Colombia/F6 (circa 1982) and Tabi (circa 2002) in terms of resilience, productivity, and cup quality. Generally, Castillo had been observed to cup as dominantly chocolatey and cherry-like with touches of citrus. For a time, there was a popular, unfavorable sentiment around Castillo's potential to cup well in comparison to older varieties like Caturra. It was in that context socially conscious and innovative producers like Diego Samuel Bermudez pursued post-harvest processing experiments intending to illustrate that the resilience and productivity of a hybrid variety like Castillo can go hand-in-hand with good, even exceptional, cup quality. This served to increase awareness among Colombian coffee farmers that they can reduce their risk of loss by planting disease-resistant varieties while remaining confident that their coffees can cup competitively and thus be valued at a premium. On top of that, their successful experiments would open up numerous trajectories for creating a diversity of unique flavor profiles, augmenting opportunities for the farmers to be better rewarded for their hard work. Finca El Paraiso and INDESTEC's ingenuity lies in having thoroughly studied, implemented, and documented their simultaneously structured and creative processing methods and techniques at such a high level of granularity that allows for consistent repeatability of their approaches and effectively unconstrains their potential to increase the diversity of probable flavor profiles, depending on the customers' preferences, varieties on hand, and the prevailing terroir conditions at the time of processing. To consistently achieve the desired cup profiles, precision in configuring the different processing parameters at every significant phase is a hallmark of harvesting, sorting, fermentation, and drying at Finca El Paraiso. In this micro-lot, coffee cherries were harvested at the optimum point of ripeness and then pre-cleaned and sorted by removing leaves, branches, and other impurities, followed by flotation to facilitate the selection of the most optimal cherries, and disinfection with ozone to remove extraneous microbiological load before proceeding to the 72-hour anaerobic fermentation phase, submerged in water and lactobacilli in milk culture medium. After fermentation, the coffee was pulped and mixed back with the fermentation fluids. To reinforce the adhesion of the aroma and flavor precursors to the beans, a Thermal Shock Washed technique was applied. Thermal Shock Washing was done by quickly turning up the temperature of the fermentation fluids to 40°C, rapidly opening up the membranes and pores of the coffee beans and facilitating the attachment of the abundant aroma and flavor precursors in the fermentation medium to them, and immediately following it with a wash using 12°C cold water to seal the coffee beans’ pores, locking the aroma and flavor precursors in. Otherwise, these precursors, such as the esters, aldehydes, organic acids, and alcohols produced by the metabolism of the earlier mentioned microorganisms as they consumed the coffee mucilage, would have remained in the leachate (i.e., not absorbed into the coffee bean), because the parchment and silver film covering the coffee beans are difficult to penetrate before Thermal Shock, and would then have wastefully just been washed off. As for the crucial drying phase, Finca El Paraiso’s custom drying and dehumidifying technology was used. It was designed with consideration to the usually highly volatile and thermolabile compounds generated during fermentation and genetically inherent in the coffees. As such, it removes moisture by mass transfer, allowing the drying phase to be accomplished without high temperatures and thereby making way for a less abrupt transition to seed dormancy. This, in effect, permits the coffee to be stored for extended periods without the risk of presenting quality defects and guarantees the highest possible quality of the final green coffee.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/colombia-m03-finca-el-paraiso
"Panama - Geisha M59, Abu Coffee","orange blossom, raspberry, floral honey, blueberry",270.00,"Description Description Producer: Jose LutrellLocation: Cañas Verdes, BoqueteVariety: GeishaProcess: NaturalAltitude: 1,550 maslCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Jose Luttrell is the founder of Abu Coffee. He was already successful as an engineer, usually in the city and traveling overseas for work, when his father took him to revisit their family's farmlands in Boquete. This sparked his interest in specialty coffee which, in time, grew into a passion. It was after his father passed away that Jose took a deep dive into producing specialty coffee and when Abu Coffee was established. Abu (short for abuelo) was the affectionate nickname Jose's children had for their grandfather. By producing distinct and excellent coffees that could not have been grown elsewhere, and sharing them with the world, they keep his memory, and his love for coffee and Boquete alive. Abu Coffee started to become known when they won 6th place in the Geisha Washed category at the 2017 Best of Panama Competition. Their Geishas have been winning yearly at the BoP from then on. In 2021, Catuai lots they produced were also awarded in the Varietal Natural and Varietal Washed categories. These consecutive BoP wins are recognized as a particularly noteworthy achievement because Abu Coffee has been in operation for less than a decade, and is much younger than most of the producers in Panama's premier coffee-growing zone. Abu Coffee is situated in Cañas Verdes, Boquete, which benefits from a tropical forest microclimate. The coffee trees are cultivated at an average elevation of 1,550 MASL on the inclines of the Volcán Barú National Park, where the rich biodiversity is well-protected. Soils are fertile, deep, well-draining, and of volcanic origin. There is a good balance of shade from native trees, and sunlight due to the estate's location. There is also the right amount of moisture from a light tropical mist in the daytime and denser fog at dusk. These conditions help the cherries' maturation process, such that sugars intensify and enrich the beans' flavor. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The legendary Panama Geisha variety is acclaimed for its sweet florality and bright overtones. Since its debut win at the Best of Panama auction in 2004, it has kept specialty coffee lovers everywhere captivated by its delicacy, complexity, and clarity of flavors. As such, it is often showcased on coffee competition stages by a great number of coffee champions, and it also continues to fetch the highest prices. The esteemed status of the Panama Geisha is also due to its scarcity, owing to the variety’s unique genetics (responsible for its exceptional cup quality) that allows it to capture the best features of the Boquete terroir, and that are not shared by Geisha grown in other origins. The plants also require longer time to grow and more diligent care due to their delicate root systems. And, since Geisha trees have wide branch spans, they need to be spaced farther apart in the farm, resulting in less cherries per hectare at harvest. At the Abu Coffee farm in Canas Verdes, ripening takes nine to ten months, and two to three months to complete the harvesting process — all by hand-collection. Further, because the trees are very tall, hand-collecting the perfectly ripe cherries requires even the most seasoned pickers to exert more effort. For Lot M-59, the cherries were carefully hand-picked at optimum maturation, and then hand-sorted and floated in mountain spring water. They then underwent a dry fermentation process on African raised beds, under the sun, for 35 days.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/panama-geisha-m59-abu-coffee

Their dedication to producing and distributing finer Colombian coffees has earned them a reputation as one of the world's renowned, larger-scale coffee distributors. Their long-running success is due to a steadfast commitment to quality and deep concern for and connections with the coffee growers they work with. The family's willingness to embrace innovative post-harvest processing approaches alongside time-tested methods has allowed them to explore new flavor trajectories not previously found in the Colombian coffee landscape. They ventured into innovative processing upon recognizing the benefit of alternative fermentation styles and keener attention to drying parameters in getting coffees to express novel and interesting tasting notes. Their application of such techniques on traditional and exotic varieties as well as relatively recent, resilient cultivars like Castillo, have been achieving the desired balance between productivity and cup quality. The Cofinet commitment to quality, sustainability, and ethical practices that allows them to produce great coffee goes hand in hand with their dedication to improving the lives of the people in communities where the coffees are grown is a key reason they enjoy high regard in the industry. As a family-owned business, their legacy — from the earliest days of sourcing and locally distributing coffee to local exporters until their operations' recent expansion encompassing global distribution — has always been driven by their passion for advancing the Colombian coffee industry within the global market and along with that uplift the quality of life of the coffee-farming families they work with. Luz Helena Salazar owns and manages the affairs at Finca Maracay, an eight-hectare farm in Armenia, Quindio. She is the mother of Cofinet founders Felipe and Carlos. Having grown up in Armenia, Quindio — the area considered to be the traditional heart of Colombia’s production — she has always had an intuitive acumen for coffee farming and has carried on a personal advocacy for Colombian coffee from her younger years. Her inherent aptitude for coffee and agronomy was further honed throughout her career managing agricultural estates yielding other produce like avocadoes and oranges. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The Castillo coffee variety is a hybrid introduced by Colombia's national coffee research institute, Cenicafe, in 2005. It was developed as an improvement from the earlier released cultivars Colombia/F6 (circa 1982) and Tabi (circa 2002), with a focus on enhancing resilience, productivity, and cup quality. Initially, Castillo was often described as dominantly chocolatey and cherry-like with subtle hints of citrus. However, there was a prevailing sentiment that it might not cup as well as older varieties such as Caturra. To challenge this notion, socially conscious and innovative began conducting post-harvest processing experiments. Their objective was to showcase that a hybrid variety like Castillo could exhibit exceptional cup quality while maintaining its resilience and productivity. These efforts not only increased awareness among Colombian coffee farmers about the benefits of planting disease-resistant varieties but also demonstrated that their coffees could compete and command premium prices based on cup quality. Whereas the traditional washed process tends to produce a clean, bright cup with a medium body and in contrast, the traditional natural typically results in a heavier-bodied cup with pronounced fruity characteristics — experimental or alternative processes have diversified the range of probable flavor profiles further. For instance, extended and anaerobic fermentation processes tend to increase the cup's complexity by intensifying fruit notes in the direction of dark, exotic, and even tropical fruits, and also enhancing mouthfeel and body. One notable example is Luz Helena Salazar's work at Finca Maracay in Armenia, Quindio. By using a Honey - Yeast Inoculation Process, where carefully selected yeasts were added during the fermentation phase, a surprising cup character with a tea-like quality and the sweetness, acidity, and aromatics of stone fruits — more commonly associated with Ethiopian heirlooms — was achieved.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/colombia-luz-helena-salazar-peach
Rwanda - Muzo Lot 04,"dark plum, cherry, banana, caramel",52.00,"Description Description Producer: Baho Coffee / Emmanuel RusatiraLocation: Gakenke DistrictVariety: Red BourbonProcess: NaturalAltitude: 1500 – 2100 MASLCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Emmanuel Rusatira founded Baho Coffee, intending to help to improve the livelihood of small coffee farmers in Rwanda. His empathy for their life struggles stems from having been born into a smallholding coffee-farming family himself. He came to a deeper understanding of the material challenges they face throughout his years directly working with them as a coffee washing station manager and realized the true extent of their plight when he oversaw upwards of 30 washing stations across the country when he was working as a Department Head of Specialty, Sustainability, and Certification. The foundations for a quality-focused coffee industry established by the Rwandese government to revive the nation after the 1994 genocide —where Emmanuel lost his parents and brother — served not only as a source of hope for survivors like him but also served as the solid ground upon which they could rebuild their lives. Emmanuel decided that the evocative Rwandese word ""baho,"" literally meaning ""have life,"" best captures and conveys his company's reason for being — which is for his smallholding coffee farmer partners to have better lives. The Muzo Washing Station takes its name from the sector where it is located and is run by the Muzo Cooperative in partnership with Baho Coffee, under a 10-year agreement. Enhancing the well-established fundamental systems to uphold quality, the station has adopted Emmanuel’s management style as Baho continues to share its operational expertise. Farmers that deliver to Muzo are recognized and rewarded by Baho Coffee for providing high-quality cherries to the washing station through premium prices and a second, bonus payment. On top of that, the company extends educational, financial, and agricultural services to smallholder farmers and has set up several social programs focused on more marginalized segments within the farming community, like women, the elderly, and the youth. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Bourbon is the only variety that made it to the Cup of Excellence the last time the auction was conducted in Rwanda. This points to Bourbon’s propensity for taking in the best qualities of terroir, which then translate into desirable qualities in the cup. Amid a dominantly washed process-oriented industry, Emmanuel sought to be one of the pioneers of natural and honey processing in Rwanda after visiting Costa Rica, where he witnessed how these methods could multiply the trajectories of flavor creation. He applied this learning in Baho to widen their coffees’ range of flavors beyond the usual associations with the bold brightness of classic Kenyans and hints of Ethiopian florality. Naturally processed, this lot boasts caramel in the cup, with a fragrant sweetness complemented by the rounded acidity of dark stone fruit. At Baho Coffee, the initial steps to process cherries are standardized. It starts with a day of intensive sorting in complete shade, to ensure only the ripest of cherries picked at most 2 to 3 hours prior, and without any visible defects, proceed to the next steps. The sorted cherries are then floated in a large container, whereby the floaters are removed, and only the densest ones go into processing as higher-grade lots. In this case, the densest cherries were placed directly onto the drying beds within a custom-built parabolic drying facility, akin to a greenhouse, to protect them from rain and too much sunlight. This drying phase can last from 50 to 55 days. During this period, the cherries are layered singly with a maximum depth of 2 to 4 cm and turned hourly for the first five days, and then every two hours until day 20. The ambient temperature and that of the coffee are closely monitored to control the pace of drying with the intention of keeping it slow. By recording temperature and moisture at regular intervals daily, the processing team can adjust their activities accordingly, whenever key drying indicators fall outside the target thresholds. For example, workers might shift the cherries more frequently or cover them with a mesh, or both, to prevent over-fermentation and the formation of molds, which would otherwise turn up in the cup as undesirable flavors indicative of defects. The drying phase ends upon reaching a moisture content of 11%, at which point the coffee in dried cherry is packed and kept in a dry warehouse until it needs to be milled.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/rwanda-muzo-lot-04

Between 2011 and 2012, they converted previous cattle farmland into a fully-equipped coffee farm focused on innovation while ensuring the well-being of the environment & the farmers. Their coffees have reaped awards on national and world coffee competition stages since 2016. 2019 was most memorable when Korea's Jooyeon Jeon used their coffee to win 1st Place in the World Barista Championship. Now in their 10th year, they continue to innovate cultivation practices, processing methods, and business models. They have re-engineered the farm from monoculture to polyculture, introduced Bio-innovation and Bio-Natural techniques, and expanded the geographic scope of their relationship coffee framework called Neighbors & Crops. The Exporter: Equation Coffee represents a small group of like-minded Panama and Colombia producers that enact eco-socially conscious choices in their coffee cultivation, processing, and marketing. They are La Palma & El Tucan, Delagua Coffee Paradise, and Creativa Coffee District. Their business model, called Neighbors & Crops, is geared towards invariably innovating and delivering premium specialty coffee while making a lasting, beneficial impact on the community and the environment. Our long-term relationship with Equation Coffee has allowed us to make internationally sought-after coffees available here in our corner of the world. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Geisha was among the first exotic varietals planted when the estate was established, spread out across five terroirs between 1650 to 1800 MASL. At these altitudes, temperatures range from 9°c and 27°c, and average precipitation is 1300 ml per year. Through years of purposeful experimentation, La Palma & El Tucan determined that an anaerobic natural process would bring out its distinctive fruity and floral qualities accompanied by a velvety texture and tartaric acidity. After fermenting in sealed tanks, the hand-sorted ripe coffee cherries were placed on raised beds for 30 to 45 days. The lengthened interaction between the cherry and the bean’s mucilage allows fuller expression of the coffee’s character in the cup. La Palma & El Tucan produces natural processed coffees in small batches because of the usually high humidity levels that present a challenge during the critical drying phase. Outside the narrow window in a year when humidity levels are ideal, a mechanical dryer is prudently used for the coffees to reach the required moisture level. The cherries are also shifted about every two hours to ensure even drying and to avoid off flavors from the growth molds or fungus. This nano-lot belongs to the estate’s Heroes Series, which comprises 90+ coffees and makes up 10% of their total production.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/colombia-geisha-nano-lot-002
Yemen - Ameen Ghaleb Al Duram,"cherry, dried fig, caramel, bakers chocolate",185.00,"Description Description Producer: Ameen Ghaleb Al Duram / Sheba CoffeeLocation: Al Durm, HarazVariety: JadiProcess: Natural AnaerobicAltitude: 1900 MASLCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Constantly beset by challenges beyond their control — from socio-economic upheavals to environmental constraints — Yemen's coffee-farming families persevere in perpetuating their forefathers' agricultural heritage. They resiliently tend to coffee trees that grow across terraces clinging to the steep and arid yet fertile highland terrains, like in the picturesque Haraz region in the Sana'a Governorate. Their cherries capture singularly extraordinary, sweet, and nuanced notes not found elsewhere, and coffee is their primary, if not only, source of livelihood. Haraz, at the forefront of Yemeni specialty coffee production, is known for its peerless landscapes. It is endearingly referred to as ""the land above the clouds"" because of its high elevation amid the Sarat mountain range, which is home to Jabal An-Nabi Shu’ayb, the highest mountain in the peninsula, and the critically endangered Arabian Leopard. Apart from the high altitudes, its location — some 150 km inland from the Red Sea’s primary port of Al-Hudaydah, parallel to the eastern coast of the Red Sea and with the Gulf of Aiden to the south — also contributes to the beneficial microclimates of the region. Due to its arduous topography, Haraz has remained beyond the reach of nonconstructive outside influences. As such, their people have been able to preserve their unique, indigenous culture — most evident in the architecture dating back to the Sulajhid dynasty in the 11th century — as well as their ancient cultivation traditions. Ameen Ghaleb Al-Darm, aged 50, and his entire family are deeply committed to the production of higher-end specialty coffee, while maintaining a modest crop of fruits and vegetables, including tomatoes, cucumbers, and potatoes, for their family’s consumption. Cognizant that their continued sustenance rests upon keeping their land well-nourished while achieving the desired level of productivity, they regularly undertake the considerable journey of 189 km to procure organic fertilizers available only in the Tihama region. Since coffee cultivation is the core of Ameen and his family’s livelihood, they have determined that the effort and expense to obtain these particularly nutrient-rich and environment-friendly farming inputs are well worth it. To bring recognition and better opportunities to coffee farmers like Ameen, Sheba Coffee was founded in 2019 by members of the Yemeni diaspora committed to harnessing their resources and connections to foster a stable and flourishing Yemeni coffee sector. Their ultimate aim is to help bring ease to Yemeni farmers’ lives and establish unshakeable roots of stability by strengthening their capacity to sustainably produce excellent coffees, whose value is highly regarded and materially rewarded by specialty coffee connoisseurs worldwide. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Jadi is one of the numerous vernacular names used to identify Yemeni coffee varieties. It is associated with coffee trees in the Sana’a Governorate, with wavy leaves and whose cherries are clustered closely together. It is lesser known than the most widely recognized Udaini variety, prominently associated with coffees from the Ibb Governorate. The discrete identity and specific attributes of coffees referred to as Jadi, along with the array of Yemeni varieities, have yet to be determined according to a recent 2022 MDPI Agronomy study. In the experience of Sheba Coffee working with Haraz-grown cherries, Jadi flavor profiles are inclined toward complex acidity and high sweetness, rich berry, and dried fruit nuances, accompanied by a winey character. For this nano-lot, Ameen and his family selectively hand-picked the reddest cherries, passing each tree multiple times every week during the harvest season to make sure the cherries are picked only at the desired ripeness level. They plucked the cherries off the trees gently and with utmost care to ensure the quality of each cherry was not compromised and that the coffee plants remained unharmed in order to protect its potential yield in subsequent seasons. These perfectly ripe cherries were then transported to Sheba’s processing center, where they were cleaned and sorted, by way of flotation, before they being taken further into the post-harvest processing steps of fermentation and drying. In this case, fermentation was done first by placing the cherries in hermetic bags for a brief duration and then interrupting the anaerobic fermentation by taking the cherries out of the bags and transferring them to a greenhouse for a similar amount of time. By suspending the anaerobic fermentation in this way, Sheba Coffee was able to enhance the coffee’s distinct cup profile. The cherries were then placed back into the hermetic bags for another short duration to continue the anaerobic fermentation. After that, they were returned to the greenhouse — already twice fermented — in order to slow-dry before finally being taken to raised beds to dry directly under the sun. During the two to three-week drying phase, the cherries were regularly turned to stabilize moisture and ensure consistent ventilation, leading to even drying and consequently only desirable sensorial attributes in the cup.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/yemen-ameen-ghaleb-al-duram
Kenya - Kiyaka AA,"strawberry, blueberries, mandarin orange, caramel",65.00,"Description Description Producer: Kiyaka EstateLocation: Kisii CountyVariety: SL28, SL34, Batian, Ruiru 11Process: NaturalAltitude: ﻿1700 maslCrop Year: ﻿2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Kiyaka Estate is a two-hectare ancestral land on a plateau in Kisii county, Nyanza region in Southwestern Kenya. The high elevation, mild climate, adequate and well-distributed rainfall, and fertile, volcanic soil make up the conditions conducive to the coffee varieties grown in the estate — SL 28, SL 34, Ruiru 11, Batian, and Blue Mountain. After inheriting the property in 2014, Edwin Nyaega Kiyaka, who was then based in the capital Nairobi, decided that city life was no longer for him and went full-time into coffee farming. He has since been engaged in organic cultivation, natural processing, and invigorating the estate's polycultural environment following an agroforestry model. Edwin has been building his reputation as one of the pioneers in a new era of Kenyan coffee production, characterized by a sharper focus on improving cup quality through eco-conscious farming practices and experimentation with natural processing. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The traditional varieties SL 28 and SL 34 have been cultivated in the country since the early 1900s. They are known for having the potential for high cup quality and high yields. Still, they are also highly vulnerable to adverse elements. The more resilient cultivars Ruiru 11 and Batian were bred and promoted to decrease the risk of another coffee disease epidemic (such as the 1968 coffee berry disease epidemic) and ultimately protect the farmers’ livelihood and the industry at large. The AA grade indicates this coffee is of the highest quality, determined by the beans’ size and density and according to Kenyan coffee trade regulations. Edwin decided to use the traditional natural process for this lot to encourage development of the coffee’s intrinsic berry and sweetish citrus character amid a darker sweetness. After the selectively handpicked ripe cherries were cleaned and further sorted, they were placed on mesh-topped wooden boxes to dry under the sun. Throughout this drying phase, which was not to exceed 30 days, meticulous care was taken to ensure off-flavors would not develop. Steps included shifting the cherries, monitoring their temperature and moisture levels, and picking out the non-uniform cherries.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/kenya-kiyaka-aa
Ethiopia - Hamasho Village Lot 2,"orange blossom, peach soda, lychee, melon, mandarin, jasmine",60.00,"Description Description Producer: Daye Bensa / Asefa Dukamo KormaLocation: Bensa, Sidama Variety: 74158 Process: NaturalAltitude: 2230 MASLCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Daye Bensa Coffee is the 2022 2nd Place Winner of the Ethiopia Cup of Excellence. Brothers Asefa and Mulugeta Dukamo started the company with one small office and a single washing station, and the vision to uplift the lives of coffee farming families in their hometown, Daye Bensa, Sidama. While the natural environment at altitudes exceeding 2000 masl was conducive to growing high-quality coffee, enabling infrastructure to process and market it did not exist. Together with his brother Mulugeta Dukamo, he would find a way to overcome this obstacle by setting up wet and dry mills at strategic locations and, not long after, their own exporting company. Now they have 71 washing stations, 11 dry mills, and three farms, with work in progress to expand to neighboring areas Guji, Bale, and West Arsi. Hundreds of smallholder farmers in the Bombe Mountains of Sidama Bensa comprise Hamasho Village, where the craft of coffee cultivation is built on generations of endurance and experience. Since they traditionally drink their own coffee, they have an instinct for what high-quality tastes like. The name Hamasho is Sidamic for snake, a cultural symbol of strength that also holds spiritual significance. With the efforts of Daye Bensa Coffee to enhance this knowledge, Hamasho Village farmers are able to maintain and even raise their crops’ quality and commercial viability. Every 50-100 partner farmers regularly receive information about healthy cultivation practices from a dedicated contact. Daye Bensa Coffee is one of Ethiopia's Top 5 Coffee Exporters. They supply 7,500 tons annually to 25 countries. Unlike others, they produce their own coffee on this massive scale and operate a relationship-based model with farmers, buyers, and other producers, allowing them to directly influence and improve their coffee's quality. With Kenean Dukamo, Asefa’s son and second-generation leader, on-board, Daye Bensa looks to build on their COE win by creating a division focused on ""intentional coffees.” They are also looking at creative collaborations with outside sectors like the arts or winemaking. Archers x Daye Bensa The Archers bond with Daye Bensa goes a long way back. It's also a connection marked by exhilarating milestones, such as: Archers’ first stint at the National Brewers Cup in 2021 where our co-founder and green buyer Frederick Bejo showcased a progressive rendering of Hamasho Village on-stage; our first creative processing collaboration that brought us exclusive Hamasho192 Hrs and Gatta Warm Anaerobic Archers lots, our inaugural learning adventure at origin when we flew to Ethiopia for the CQI Q Processing 2 The Professional at Gatta Farm, Sidama Bensa, and that epic private cupping event featuring 20 cup profiles expressed by a single Ethiopian variety processed in 20 different ways. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process ‘Ethiopian heirloom’ is the general term commonly used to identify coffee originating from Ethiopia. It covers two classifications: Jimma Agricultural Research Center (JARC) varieties and regional landrace varieties. JARC varieties were developed and released to improve the productivity and livelihood of smallholder coffee farmers and boost the country's coffee industry. They are promoted and bred because of their good quality when grown at the recommended elevations, resistance to or tolerance of adverse elements, and adaptability to diverse environments. There are 40+ JARC varieties comprised mostly of pure line selections and a handful of hybrids. Regional landraces, meanwhile, are varieties that propagate in the wild, without regulated interventions. 74158 is a JARC variety whose flavor potential we have grown familiar with in our years of working with Daye Bensa. The first Hamasho Village Natural we tasted and subsequently offered surprised us with notes resembling the Panama Geisha's — intense floral aromatics with fresh tropical and stone fruit qualities. Archers’ first Hamasho Village Natural was in 2020, which had notes of jasmine, orange blossom, lychee, apricot, and lemongrass. From 2020 to 2022, Hamasho Village Natural has consistently carried signature jasmine and lychee notes, while introducing some delicious variability throughout as well. For example, the crop also expressed apricot in 2020 and 2021, enlivening the profile with a hint of sweet tanginess as well as the invigorating aromatic nuance of lemongrass. Then, in 2022 new fruit notes emerged like blueberries and orange, along with caramel, which gave the cup a certain juiciness and a measure of richness and depth. As a result of natural processing in this 2023 crop, Hamasho Village Lot 2 expresses the signature notes of jasmine and lychee, alongside the return of orange blossom, and together with amplified sweetness and new layers of intricacy with notes of peach soda, melon, and mandarine.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-hamasho-village-lot-2
Panama - Janson Lot 140 Geisha,"tangerine, jasmine, mixed berries, red grapes",265.00,"Description Description Producer: Janson CoffeeLocation: Los Alpes, Tizingal Variety: Green Tip GeishaProcess: Natural, 72hrs FermentationAltitude: 1,700 maslCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Three generations of Jansons run the operations of Janson Coffee today. Kai and Jannette Janson, both from the second generation and Miguel, Janette’s son, are at the forefront. Their coffees have been awarded and auctioned several times at the Best of Panama, and are often featured by coffee champions on the world stage. 2023 has so far been a hallmark year for @kaijanson, @jannettejanson, and the rest of the Janson coffee family as they were part of that dream team who took home the top trophy at the 2023 World Barista Championship, with a Janson Geisha at the core of the winning routine, as well as podium finishers at the 2023 World Brewers Cup. At the Best of Panama 2023, Janson Geisha Natural ranked 3rd, while Geisha Washed placed 5th. Their family’s work in coffee began in the mid-1980s when the first generation realized their land’s potential for coffee cultivation after receiving advice from agricultural engineers. And it was in 1990 that Janson Coffee was officially established by Michael, Carl, Ricardo†, and Peter Janson. They were inspired by their father’s dedication to hard work, quality, and love for their land. Since the company’s founding, their vision has been to produce high-quality specialty coffee consumed and enjoyed in Panama and abroad. Their father was Carl Axel Janson, a Swedish immigrant who acquired and established the original Janson hacienda, a cattle farm, in 1941. As a family enterprise, they continue to be driven by the passion to produce excellent coffees while preserving their land and improving the quality of life of their collaborators and their respective families. Two coffee plantations, spanning 100 hectares combined, comprise Janson Coffee. Both are located on the Talamanca Mountain Range, on the inclines of the Tizingal and Baru volcanoes. Different varieties are cultivated on them — Catuai, Caturra, Pacamara, and Panama Geisha. Hacienda las Lagunas is in Tierras Altas, the High Lands District, in Volcan. Its name comes from the wetlands and lagoons in the vicinity. Located west of the Barú Volcano, Hacienda las Lagunas is rich in volcanic soil and has access to natural springs. Areas of natural reserve surround the different lots in the coffee farm and act as natural barriers. They also serve as essential habitats for a diversity of birds and wildlife. Meanwhile, Los Alpes, named after the Swiss Alps sits on the slopes of the Tizingal volcano, amid the Talamanca Mountain range in the westernmost part of Panama, northwest of the Barú Volcano and adjacent to the La Amistad International Park, which is a natural reserve and UNESCO World Heritage Site. This park crosses the Panamanian border into Costa Rica and shelters rich biodiversity, including the famous Quetzal bird. Raising the Energy Around Coffee At our February 2023 Producer’s Talk, when Kai shared his thoughts on how he sees specialty coffee evolving, we gained insight into the impetus for the innovations at Janson Coffee that result in the fascinating flavor profiles in our cup. What he said also lightly touched on the consumer's role in shaping the future of specialty coffee. He told us, ""It's an amazing ride — to see coffee grow and the energy around coffee… Our intention is, how do you create a coffee that is so fruity that you know it's a natural, and so powerful you know it's anaerobic, and so clean and gorgeous that it's like a classic washed — all in one cup, and at different points in the cup…if you're paying attention, you'll see that."" He also mentioned that brewing plays a large part in upholding quality. When we asked what's on the horizon for Janson Coffee, Kai shared that their goal is to keep raising the energy around coffee. We took this to mean: continuing to chase excellence in coffee quality and keeping everyone excited about it by creating genuine relationships and fun shared experiences with the coffee people they encounter. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The legendary Geisha variety is acclaimed for its sweet florality and bright overtones. Since its debut win at the Best of Panama auction in 2004, it has kept specialty coffee lovers everywhere captivated by its endless possibilities, delicacy, complexity, and clarity of flavors. As such, it is often showcased on coffee competition stages by a great number of coffee champions, and it also continues to fetch the highest prices. Throughout their 30+ year history, the Jansons have relied on the experience of their founders while remaining attentive to every step and fine-tuning areas of production, from cultivation to processing, that will allow them to produce increasingly more delicious coffees. To begin with, they maintain the balance of nutrients in the soil by preserving the endemic flora in their farms, which serve as natural barriers and obviate the need for pesticides or herbicides. Pickers are trained to select and hand-collect only the properly ripe cherries at harvest, and to further re-assess the cherries in their baskets and remove any that do not conform. These are then carefully placed in plastic crates, and no longer in sacks, to be sent for processing. This change was done to remove the risk of the cherries being compressed, and losing juices and sugars beneficial to flavor development, while in transit to the beneficio or plant. Upon reaching the plant, the cherries are passed through a mechanical siphon to separate the denser cherries from the rest before going into fermentation. This is done since the highest potential for the best flavors rests within the healthiest cherries, typically indicated by a higher density. Alpes Panama Geisha Lot 140 underwent 72 hours of natural fermentation. Prior to the final drying phase, the cherries were first laid out on the patio for a couple of days to remove excess moisture. In the daytime, they were moved periodically to encourage even drying, and in the afternoon, the cherries were taken and kept in a warehouse to avoid getting wet and to allow for more sugar and flavors to be absorbed into the bean from the pulp. Finally, they were placed on raised beds to dry for 14 days resulting in an intricate cup with a complementary interplay creamy, clean, syrupy, juicy, rounded, and tart notes.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/panama-janson-lot-140-geisha
"Panama - Symmetry, Iris Estate","white grapes, tropical fruit, mandarine, raspberry candy",355.00,"Description Description Producer: Jamison Savage / Iris EstateLocation: Volcan, Chiriqui, PanamaVariety: Green Tip GeishaProcess: Natural Carbonic MacerationAltitude: 1850-2300 MASLCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Jamison Savage of Finca Deborah, Iris Estate, and Savage Coffees is known throughout the specialty coffee world due to his pioneering methods. Engaged in progressive processing techniques and farming practices respectful of nature, Jamison lets the most favorable, naturally occurring sensory nuances of a coffee shine on the palate. It’s a feat accomplished by few and evidently appreciated worldwide, as national and world coffee competitors frequently choose to showcase his coffees. 2016 saw his prowess shine brighter when Taiwan’s Berg Wu won the World Barista Championship using a Geisha from Finca Deborah. Since then, numerous national champions have entrusted Jamison to design coffees for their routines on the world stage. Among them are our very own WBrC representative David Disuanco and France's Charity Cheung. It was in the early 2000s when Jamison, at the height of his finance career in the US, decided a change was in order. He longed for a freer lifestyle to give himself and his family a chance to spend more time outdoors and to travel. At the same time, he was looking for a real estate asset to fill a gap in his investment portfolio. In our 2022 Producer’s Talk, Jamison shared that they were choosing between Panama and New Zealand. Panama eventually won out for practical reasons and the sheer beauty and promise of the land. Their deliberation and preparation took about five years and culminated in 2008, the year the Savage family uprooted and started anew on foreign soil. They made their new home in the Volcan region of the Chiriqui province, the seat of Panama Geisha cultivation and home to Finca Deborah, Iris Estate, and Savage Coffees. Iris Estate, the latest in Jamison’s pursuit of the perfect cup, is a collaboration with Sasa Sestic of Project Origin and Elvin Chin Wei of Cloud Catcher. Situated at extreme elevations amid the pristine environs of Volcan, Iris Estate’s founders believe it is where all the ideal conditions converge for ‘super-specialty’ coffee to ‘create itself.’ The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Panama Geisha cherries take their time to sweeten in the cooler temperatures at the extreme altitudes of Iris Estate, aided by the right amount of shade and sunlight owing to the luxuriant rainforest cover and the farm’s favorable orientation to the sun. Processed with tact and intention, Iris Estate Symmetry is another eloquent expression of the very land it grew on. Symmetry started with harvesting perfectly ripe Panama Geisha cherries, registering 21-24 on the BRIX meter. These cherries were twice sorted and selected before being deposited into hermetically sealed, stainless steel tanks, where they remained for upwards of 100 hours. During this period, CO2 was introduced at regular intervals amid a controlled and regulated fermentation environment. This was also the time the coffee seeds could absorb high fruit notes and finer aromatics from the cherry itself. Temperature and PH were monitored throughout this duration, ensuring these variables stayed within pre-defined limits. Following their extended stay inside the sealed tanks, the cherries were removed and laid out on the three-tiered, raised African bed system designed by Jamison for the drying phase. During this phase, temperatures, humidity, and airflow were also maintained within specific parameters in the shaded drying areas, also referred to as dry houses, as the cherries were consistently and carefully shifted throughout the day for even drying. These steps were carried out to prevent undesired microbial activity from occurring and to promote the development only of desired flavors. The cherries spent around 30 days on the drying beds before reaching the proper moisture level of approximately 11%. To protect the quality that had painstakingly been created, they were then bagged in Grain-pro and stored under optimal conditions of cool and stable temperatures for a reposo or seasoning process critical in Jamison's stringent end-to-end QC protocol. In reposo, the coffee's moisture content stabilized while allowing it to keep absorbing more flavor from its parchment or shell, before being hulled and further sorted by size, density, and color, and finally shipped to us. About the Panama Geisha Panama Geisha, of which Green Tip Geisha is one variation, is a rare, delicate, and complex variety well-loved for its sweet florality and citrus highlights. Since its debut win at the Best of Panama auction in 2004, it has kept specialty coffee lovers everywhere captivated by its endless possibilities, delicacy, complexity, and clarity of flavors. As such, it is often showcased on coffee competition stages by a great number of coffee champions, and it also continues to fetch the highest prices. While a coffee’s truest intrinsic qualities are still largely believed to be showcased best by traditional washed processing due to the demucilaging, washing, and scrubbing steps removing all traces of fruit from the bean, the expertise of seasoned and passionate producers like Jamison Savage allows them to direct the flavor character of the Panama Geisha towards a seemingly endless diversity of delightfully surprising trajectories. They do this through the purposeful implementation of traditional methods like the natural and honey processes, as well as intentional and innovative processing styles, such as this Natural Carbonic Maceration process, which add to the complexity of the cup’s character — for example, more layers of flavor or better mouthfeel — without compromising its inherent qualities from terroir and variety.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/panama-symmetry

This signifies the cooperative’s capacity for efficient and quality-driven practices as a way to increase the value of their affiliated farmers’ coffee and compensate them accordingly. They operate three wet mills in one of the country’s most known coffee-growing zones, Kirinyaga county in Central Kenya, also known as the Mount Kenya region. The county is extensively forested, rich in volcanic soil, and has moderate temperatures year-round. These beneficial conditions give way to coffee trees that yield denser cherries with the potential for diverse flavors. There is also consistent government support for coffee farmers in the form of training and access to farm inputs. Generations of farmers in this locality predominantly grow SL 28 and SL 34 varieties, as they had been working with coffee before the popularization of cultivars Ruiru 11 and Batian. The Kii Coffee Factory is one of the three Rung’eto Cooperative wet mills providing processing services to the smallholder farmers in its vicinity. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process SL 28 and SL 34 are the traditional varieties cultivated in the country since the early 1900s. They have the potential for high cup quality and high yields, but also highly vulnerable to adverse elements. The AA-grade indicates this coffee is of the highest quality, determined by the beans’ size and density according to the regulations governing the Kenyan coffee trade. It is a long held belief that the washed process fully unmasks a coffee’s authentic character allowing the consumer to taste variety and terroir. It is still the norm for post-harvest processing at the cooperative-run coffee factories in Kenya. Selectively handpicked ripe cherries are further sorted for defects before being sent into pulping, which removes the skin and pulp from the seed. Residual mucilage is then removed through fermentation in tanks, followed by washing to scrub off any remaining traces of mucilage, and a soak. This lot from the Kii wet mill was fermented in ambient temperature for approximately 24 hours, and washed using clean water from the Kii River, followed by a 12-hour soak. By this step, the coffee seeds in parchment would have a moisture level of around 55%. This will be reduced to 10-12% by laying them out to dry on raised beds under the sun for approximately 14 days. Kenyan coffee is memorable for many specialty coffee lovers because it is generally fragrant, clean, juicy, complex, and also fuller-bodied, which is uncommon in most other fully washed coffees.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/kenya-kii-aa
Ethiopia - Alo Village Archers Lot Washed,"orange blossom, white grapes, lemongrass, peach",145.00,"Description Description Producer: Tamiru Tadesse / Alo CoffeeLocation: Alo Village, Bensa, SidamaVariety: 74158Process: Anaerobic WashedAltitude: 2,450 maslCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Only a year into establishing Alo Coffee Export Plc, Tamiru Tadesse had already managed to foster a commendable reputation among specialty coffee connoisseurs around the world, with a burgeoning client base across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In 2021 Tamiru won 1st Place at the Ethiopia Cup of Excellence & advanced closer toward his goal of bringing greater recognition and rewards to Sidama Bensa coffee farmers, whose hard work and dedication make top-quality coffees possible. Six years working in coffee, Sidama Bensa-born Tamiru saw the great disconnect between the exceptional flavors and high cup quality potential of his hometown's coffees and the way these were being undervalued across the market. It was also too clear to him how this put the smallholder coffee-growing families and the country's coffee industry at a huge disadvantage. A friend of Tamiru winning the 2020 Ethiopia Cup of Excellence inspired him to personally contribute to a solution by starting his company, Alo Coffee. Through Alo Coffee, he is able to provide the means for smallholders to process their laboriously cultivated, inherently organic, and flavor-rich coffee cherries into distinctive lots of the highest quality, and then match them with the specialty coffee communities that recognize their value and properly reward it. Alo Village is the site of the company’s processing headquarters where the coffee growers in the vicinity bring their coffee cherries for post-harvest processing. It is situated at remarkably high elevations from 2,400 masl. Like the rest of the smallholder farmers in the country, the inhabitants of Alo Village rely on the farmlands granted to their families by the government for income mostly from coffee and food mostly comprising false banana and maize. Since each parcel covers about 1 – 2 hectares at most, coffee yields by household are constrained and volumes do not reach marketable levels, until they are aggregated by producers like Alo Coffee. On their own, each family and the community do not have the most current knowhow and sufficient resources to increase their farms’ productivity, nor to maintain and enhance the quality of the soils as well as that of their coffee cherries post-harvest. The involvement of quality-oriented and eco-socially committed specialty coffee producers like Alo Coffee contributes to alleviating the livelihood of the coffee-farming families, such as in Alo Village. To immediately benefit the smallholder coffee growers, Alo Coffee purchases their coffee cherries at a significant premium that provides a decent income to cover household essentials and their children’s education-related expenses. With a view for the longer term, Alo Coffee also provides direct assistance to the smallholder farmers through knowledge-sharing around better practices in agronomy, cultivation, farm maintenance, and harvesting, while initiating and funding community development projects such as building schools in the communities within their scope. Further, by overseeing the end-to-end conduct of post-harvest processing, Alo Coffee unburdens the smallholders of the related risks and costs, enabling them to focus their attention and energy on maintaining the natural, unblemished condition of the land and looking after their coffee trees to ensure they flourish. By association with Tamiru and Alo Coffee, coffee-growing communities like Alo Village also have a better chance of their concerns and interests being acknowledged, advanced, and addressed by influential stakeholders across the industry.

The Archers Lot Archers Lots culminate our co-founders’ creativity and technical acumen to compose truly artisanal specialty coffee experiences for both the discerning and adventurous specialty coffee connoisseurs, in collaboration with our closest producing partners. In this Archers-curated 120-hour anaerobic washed process, Alo Village smallholder farmers brought the perfectly ripe, hand-harvested to the Alo Washing Station, where they were screened at the door and then sorted again to ensure uniformity of the ripeness level (visually indicated by color) before being pre-cleaned and then placed in 50-60 KG plastic barrels. This was done to aid in maintaining an oxygen-free fermentation phase throughout the pre-determined 120-hour period, after which the cherries were de-pulped and fully de-mucilaged. Following that, the barrels were emptied onto the raised beds, as the coffee beans were spread out in very thin layers. The specific instruction to maintain very thin layers throughout the sun-drying phase was deliberate, to avoid extraneous microbial activity as the coffees had already undergone the necessary fermentation in the barrels prior. The target moisture level was achieved after 12 to 15 days. As a result of this process, this cup expresses a crystalline, complex character with discrete layers of heightened floral and fresh aromatics alongside subtle yet crisp acidity interlaced with succulent, stonefruit sweetness.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-alo-village-archers-lot-washed
"Colombia - P02 Red Plum, Finca El Paraiso","granadilla, dark cherry, purple grapes, raspberry",65.00,"Description Description Producer: Diego Samuel BermudezLocation: Piendamó, Cauca Variety: CastilloProcess: Thermal Shock WashedAltitude: 1960 MASLCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Finca El Paraiso is the realization of one family’s dream of a coffee farm as a kind of paradise. It started to materialize in 2008 when Diego Samuel Bermudez and his family began to cultivate an assortment of traditional, novel, and exotic coffee varieties across the well-endowed and sky-reaching terrains of Vereda Los Arados, Tunía in the Piendamó municipality of the Cauca department in Colombia. It is their family’s flagship farm, spanning 49 hectares, and the headquarters of their trailblazing post-harvest processing company, INDESTEC S.A.S, shorthand for “Innovation and Technological Development for Agriculture.” This is their platform for ongoing research into and the promotion of precise and purposeful experimental methods and techniques, like the stirringly named “Thermal Shock,” intended to create a cornucopia of peerless cup profiles. Their aim — to distinguish Finca El Paraiso among the department and the nation’s accomplished and prolific producers, generate greater interest across global specialty coffee lovers, elevate the value of Cauca-grown coffees, and on the whole, contribute to continuously raising the profile and position of Colombia as an innovative and pre-eminent origin of higher-end specialty coffees. Finca El Paraiso’s location on the Pan-American route between Popayán, Cauca’s capital, and Cali, a municipality in the neighboring department Valle del Cauca, with a prevailing climate described as temperate-humid and the frequent incidence of winds from the Pacific, has been attributed for the tropical notes frequently perceived in their coffees. Meanwhile, Cauca is one of the 21 officially designated coffee-growing departments of Colombia, which was granted its “Denomination of Origin” in 2011 as a testament to the remarkable quality and distinct flavor identity of its coffees. Due to Colombia’s immense heterogeneity of microclimates, terroirs, varieties, and their resultant flavor characters, Colombia is regarded in the world of coffee as a “Land of Diversity.” When traditionally washed, Cauca coffees are generally characterized as clean, soft, and fragrant, with pronounced caramelized aromas and carrying flavors tending toward high acidity with discernible sweet and floral notes, a medium body, and a balanced overall impression. Amid this backdrop, Finca El Paraiso truly caught the specialty coffee world’s attention when Diego Samuel made it to the Top 10 of the 2018 Cup of Excellence with a double anaerobic Bourbon, and again counted among the 2019 winners with a washed anaerobic Castillo. Five years on from their first COE accolade and 15 years after Finca El Paraiso’s founding, the family emblem Finca Paraiso has come to encompass six more farms — Villa Rosita, Villa Alejandro, Villa Esperanza, Sur, El Rubi, and El Manizales — and their family’s dream continues to prosper while empowering the communities they work with to succeed. They do this through INDESTEC’s six action pillars — Technology, Knowledge Management, Collaboration, Sustainable Marketing, Resource Management, and Rural Alliances. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The Castillo variety is a hybrid introduced by Colombia’s national coffee research institute, Cenicafe, in 2005 to mitigate the risk of debilitating productivity declines in the event of a coffee disease epidemic. It was developed as an improvement from the earlier released cultivars Colombia/F6 (circa 1982) and Tabi (Circa 2002) in terms of resilience, productivity, and cup quality. Generally, Castillo had been observed to cup as dominantly chocolatey and cherry-like with touches of citrus. For a time, there was a popular, unfavorable sentiment around Castillo's potential to cup well in comparison to older varieties like Caturra. It was in that context socially conscious and innovative producers like Diego Samuel Bermudez pursued post-harvest processing experiments intending to illustrate that the resilience and productivity of a hybrid variety like Castillo can go hand-in-hand with good, even exceptional, cup quality. This served to increase awareness among Colombian coffee farmers that they can reduce their risk of loss by planting disease-resistant varieties while remaining confident that their coffees can cup competitively and thus be valued at a premium. On top of that, their successful experiments would open up numerous trajectories for creating a diversity of unique flavor profiles, augmenting opportunities for the farmers to be better rewarded for their hard work. Finca El Paraiso and INDESTEC's ingenuity lies in having thoroughly studied, implemented, and documented their simultaneously structured and creative processing methods and techniques at such a high level of granularity that allows for consistent repeatability of their approaches and effectively unconstrains their potential to increase the diversity of probable flavor profiles, depending on the customers' preferences, varieties on hand, and the prevailing terroir conditions at the time of processing. To consistently achieve the desired cup profiles, precision in configuring the different processing parameters at every significant phase is a hallmark of harvesting, sorting, fermentation, and drying at Finca El Paraiso. For our P-02 Red Plum, overripe coffee cherries were deliberately collected due to the longer contact time between their pulp and coffee seeds, allowing more of the concentration of tannins, polyphenols, esters, and other compounds in the pulp to be transmitted into the seeds, imparting red fruit attributes to the beans. The cherries were then pre-cleaned and sorted by removing leaves, branches, and other impurities, followed by flotation to facilitate the selection of the most optimal cherries, and disinfection with ozone to remove extraneous microbiological load before proceeding to the 36-hour anaerobic fermentation phase, submerged in water. After fermentation, coffee was pulped and demucilaginated. The pulp and mucilage were taken to the main processing plant and used to produce specific microorganisms that would constitute the culture medium called “Yeast Red Fruits” containing the precursors of the desired aromas and flavors. The resultant culture medium was then added to the coffee for another 12 hours of fermentation, allowing the precursors to adhere to the coffee beans through pressure. To reinforce the adhesion of the aroma and flavor precursors to the beans, a Thermal Shock Washed technique was applied. Thermal Shock Washing was done by quickly turning up the temperature of the fermentation fluids to 40°C, rapidly opening up the membranes and pores of the coffee beans and facilitating the attachment of the abundant aroma and flavor precursors in the fermentation medium to them, and immediately following it with a wash using 12°C cold water to seal the coffee beans’ pores, locking the aroma and flavor precursors in. Otherwise, these precursors, such as the esters, aldehydes, organic acids, and alcohols produced by the metabolism of the earlier mentioned microorganisms as they consumed the coffee mucilage, would have remained in the leachate (i.e., not absorbed into the coffee bean), because the parchment and silver film covering the coffee beans are difficult to penetrate before Thermal Shock, and would then have wastefully just been washed off. As for the crucial drying phase, Finca El Paraiso’s custom drying and dehumidifying technology was used. It was designed with consideration to the usually highly volatile and thermolabile compounds generated during fermentation and genetically inherent in the coffees. As such, it removes moisture by mass transfer, allowing the drying phase to be accomplished without high temperatures, and thereby making way for a less abrupt transition to seed dormancy. This, in effect, permits the coffee to be stored for extended periods without the risk of presenting quality defects and guarantees the highest possible quality of the final green coffee.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/colombia-p02-red-plum-finca-el-paraiso

"Panama - Adenium Archers Lot, Finca Deborah","jasmine, pear, nectarine, strawberry, mandarine",390.00,"Description Description Producer: Jamison Savage / Finca Deborah Location: Volcan, Chiriqui, PanamaVariety: Green Tip GeishaProcess: Nitrogen-Based Anaerobic, Washed FinishAltitude: 1700-1900 MASLCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Jamison Savage of Finca Deborah, Iris Estate, and Savage Coffees is known throughout the specialty coffee world due to his pioneering methods. Engaged in progressive processing techniques and farming practices respectful of nature, Jamison lets the most favorable, naturally occurring sensory nuances of a coffee shine on the palate. It’s a feat accomplished by few and evidently appreciated worldwide, as national and world coffee competitors frequently choose to showcase his coffees. 2016 saw Finca Deborah in the limelight when Taiwan’s Berg Wu won the World Barista Championship using a Geisha from the estate. Since then, numerous national champions have entrusted Jamison to design coffees for their routines on the world stage. Among them are our very own WBrC representative David Disuanco and France's Charity Cheung. The Finca Deborah story started long before 2016 and far away from Panama though. It was in the early 2000s when Jamison, at the height of his finance career in the US, decided a change was in order. He longed for a freer lifestyle to give himself and his family a chance to spend more time outdoors and to travel. At the same time, he was looking for a real estate asset to fill a gap in his investment portfolio. In our 2022 Producer’s Talk, Jamison shared that they were choosing between Panama and New Zealand. Panama eventually won out for practical reasons and the sheer beauty and promise of the land. Their deliberation and preparation took about five years and culminated in 2008, the year the Savage family uprooted and started anew on foreign soil. They made their new home in the Volcan region of the Chiriqui province, the seat of Panama Geisha cultivation and home to Finca Deborah, Iris Estate, and Savage Coffees. Finca Deborah is Jamison Savage’s foremost terroir-cognizant coffee plantation at 1,700 to 1,900 masl in Volcan, Chiriqui. The farm, which rests beneath a rainforest canopy, is organically cultivated and entirely solar-powered. In those pristine surroundings, the elegant Panama Geisha trees flourish, so cherries simply take in and contain the innate lushness and vibrance of the environment. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Adenium is a multi-variable processed competition-level Panama Green Tip Geisha, designed by Jamison exclusively for Archers. It’s a coffee of character that demonstrates the capability of several innovative techniques Jamison has pioneered and refined over the years to merely magnify the virtues of the perfect match between Panama Geisha and Finca Deborah’s exquisite terroir — only, intensified to express clear yet heavy fruit notes and layered complexity. Adenium delivers a championship-caliber cup that dispels the notion of alternative processing approaches compromising terroir and variety. On the contrary, it’s a compelling example of how the purposeful and precise execution of such approaches serves to elevate them. The proprietary approach to produce Adenium incorporated novel anaerobic techniques using inert gas, as well as a progressive washing technique concluding the post-harvest process. To start, perfectly ripe Green Tip Geisha cherries reading 21-24 on the BRIX meter were harvested. These cherries were twice sorted and selected before being deposited into hermetically sealed, stainless steel tanks. Inert gas was introduced into the tanks at regular intervals in the primary stages, and then natural CO2 was permitted to accumulate as the cherries fermented, creating a natural anaerobic environment. It was also during this time the coffee seeds absorbed high fruit notes and finer aromatic qualities. All throughout the fermentation phase, the cherries were constantly monitored and cataloged for both PH and temperature levels. The Finca Deborah team complied with strict parameters to ensure the process would only preserve and enhance the meticulously cultivated and harvested Panama Geisha's inherent sensory characteristics, and in no way allow them to acquire any unwanted notes or ""off"" flavors. After the cherries spent the requisite extended time inside the tanks, they were taken out to be washed. Washing was done by way of a proprietary technique that left a percentage of cherry remaining on the seeds Following the wash, Adenium was laid out on the three-tiered, raised African bed system designed by Jamison. Temperatures, humidity, and airflow were carefully controlled throughout the drying phase inside dry houses. These metrics were also maintained within certain parameters to avoid corrupting the high quality of the coffee. The cherries were also consistently and carefully shifted throughout the day for even drying, to prevent undesired microbial activity from occurring and to promote the development only of desired flavors. The cherries spent about 15-20 days on the drying beds before reaching the proper moisture level of approximately 11%. To protect the quality that had painstakingly been created, they were then bagged in Grain-pro and stored under optimal conditions of cool and stable temperatures for a reposo or seasoning process critical in Jamison's stringent end-to-end QC protocol. About the Panama Geisha Panama Geisha, of which Green Tip Geisha is one variation, is a rare, delicate, and complex variety well-loved for its sweet florality and citrus highlights. Since its debut win at the Best of Panama auction in 2004, it has kept specialty coffee lovers everywhere captivated by its endless possibilities, delicacy, complexity, and clarity of flavors. As such, it is often showcased on coffee competition stages by a great number of coffee champions, and it also continues to fetch the highest prices. While a coffee’s truest intrinsic qualities are still largely believed to be showcased best by traditional washed processing due to the demucilaging, washing, and scrubbing steps removing all traces of fruit from the bean, the expertise of seasoned and passionate producers like Jamison Savage allows them to direct the flavor character of the Panama Geisha towards a seemingly endless diversity of delightfully surprising trajectories. They do this through the purposeful implementation of traditional methods like the natural and honey processes, as well as intentional and innovative processing styles, such as this Nitrogen-Based Anaerobic, Washed Finish process, which add to the complexity of the cup’s character — for example more layers of flavor or better mouthfeel — without compromising its inherent qualities from terroir and variety.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/panama-adenium-archers-lot

The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process SL 28 is among the better known varieties that originated in East Africa and is most notably regarded for its characteristic bright, bold, and heavy-bodied cup profile. The SL 28 grown at Volcan Azul has taken 4th place at the Cup of Excellence and has also been featured by World Barista and World Brewers Cup competitors. Quality production starts with ensuring nutrient-rich soil and protection from diseases that will allow healthy coffee trees to grow. This is a cyclical exercise carried out consistently to maintain and build on the gains from the previous years. At the time of harvest, only cherries at peak ripeness are hand-picked. These are cherries whose mucilage registers at least 22% on the Brix meter, indicating optimal sugar content and allowing Alejo the flexibility to select the most suitable fermentation and drying techniques to produce the desired cup attributes. To anchor the vibrant and complex acidity of SL 28 in a rich sweetness, a Natural Anaerobic process was used. The cherries were placed in sealed tanks with a valve allowing oxygen to exit and be replaced by CO2.

The cherries are carefully selected for a second time before being stored inside the hermetically sealed tanks. The cherries remain in the tank for more than 100 hours where CO2 is periodically infused allowing for a precise and controlled fermentation. During this time, while fermenting under a controlled process, the coffee grains slowly absorb the fruit's high notes and aromatic qualities. Through monitoring temperature and PH several times a day, it ensures these variables remain within their curves. After the cherries spend their extended time inside the sealed tanks, the coffees are removed and placed on a three-tiered raised African bed system designed by Jamison. Temperatures, heat, humidity, and airflow are carefully controlled inside the dry houses and maintained within specific parameters to avoid damage to the coffee. The coffee is consistently agitated throughout the day to allow even drying. After approximately 20 days in the dry house, the coffee dried to around 11%. It is then bagged in grain-pro and stored in a bodega where temperatures are cool and stable. This reposo or seasoning process is critical to quality control.

The Producer Daye Bensa Coffee is the 2022 2nd Place Winner of the Ethiopia Cup of Excellence. The company was founded over 20 years ago by Asefa Dukamo with the vision to uplift the lives of coffee farming families in his hometown Daye in the Bensa district of Ethiopia’s Sidama region. Growing up, he appreciated the beauty and rewards of the trade but also noticed the hardships faced by the farmers daily and in the long term. While the natural environment at altitudes exceeding 2000 masl was conducive to growing high-quality coffee, enabling infrastructure to process and market it did not exist. Together with his brother Mulugeta Dukamo, he would find a way to overcome this obstacle by setting up wet and dry mills at strategic locations and, not long after, their own exporting company. Daye Bensa Coffee is active in educating the farming community about quality, mindful that this is crucial for the trade to thrive and provide stable livelihood for generations to come. Archers x Daye Bensa Coffee The Archers and Daye Bensa Coffee partnership started in 2020 with an offering of Peaberry Shantawene Natural and Hamasho Village Natural. Well-received by our community, we worked closely with Daye Bensa to add more of their coffees to our collection.

Panama - Elida Geisha Natural Plano 0602,"cotton fruit, mixed berries, stewed stone fruits, skittles",285.00,"Description Description Producer: Lamastus Family EstatesLocation: Baru Volcano Boquete, PanamaVariety: GeishaProcess: Natural ASDAltitude: 1700 - 1950 MASLCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer The Lamastus Family Estates have accrued the most Best of Panama awards to date. They won the Producer of the Year Award in 2022, which followed their two peat victories in 2018 for the Washed Geisha category and in 2019 for both Washed and Natural. A coffee company founded in 1918 by Robert Lamastus, they have evolved with the times under the leadership of Robert's son Thatcher, grandson Wilford Sr., and great-grandson Wilford Jr. Their four farms are Elida, El Burro, Luito, and Lulo. Each one benefits from discrete microclimates which, together with variety, are primarily responsible for the intricacies and flavor potential of their coffees. Elida Estate is the foremost and flagship farm. It is also the company's headquarters, where the family spends most of their time and where Wilford Sr. would be found working every day. It was named as a tribute to the Lamastus family matriarch, Elida, who single-handedly raised her children and took charge of all farm operations after her husband Robert passed away in the early 1930s. It would take almost two decades before any of her children could assist. About half of Elida Estate is located within the Volcan Baru National Park, one of Central America’s highest volcanoes, which is also a protected ecological reserve and sanctuary for exotic flora and fauna. Among the Estate’s unique world conditions are: high elevation, volcanic soils, low temperatures, beneficial microorganisms, mist during the dry season, and virgin-native cloudy rain forest surrounding the coffee trees. The low night-time temperatures allow for protracted ripening of the coffee cherries, which help make them healthier and the resulting coffee beans sweeter. The Plano Lot within Elida Estate is a partially shade-grown area situated at the entrance of Elida, where the mill is located. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Recognizing they have been blessed with the ideal terroir, the Lamastus family profoundly believes their coffees are a gift from Mother Nature. Respectful of that, they favor innovations in drying techniques and experiment with fermentation but without the use of additional, external materials. They also implement traditional methods such as the classic washed, natural, and honey processes. No matter the method, Lamastus Family Estates enforce strict protocols at every stage to achieve excellent quality consistently. In this Panama Geisha lot that went through a Natural Anaerobic Slow Dry process, hand-harvested red burgundy cherries were first fermented for five days in the Lamastus’ proprietary Reactor Fermenter (RF), a sealed and rotary stainless steel tank. Since this RF is constantly rotating, it allows for for even distribution of the concentrated fermentation juices among all of the cherries. After fermentation, the cherries were placed in thick layers on drying beds, subject to regular movement and close monitoring, for an extended period of more than 25 days. As a result, the cup character of this lot was directed toward a greater intensity of multifaceted sweetness well-balanced by similarly complex acidities from a medley of clear tropical, berry, and stewed stone fruit notes. While a coffee’s truest intrinsic qualities are still largely believed to be showcased best by traditional washed processing due to the demucilaging, washing, and scrubbing steps removing all traces of fruit from the bean, the expertise of seasoned and passionate producers like Wilford Sr. allows them to direct the flavor character of their coffees, like the Panama Geisha, towards a seemingly endless diversity of delightfully surprising trajectories through other methods. They do this through the purposeful implementation of other traditional methods like the natural and honey processes, as well as intentional and innovative processing styles, all of which add to the complexity of the cup’s character — for example with added layers of flavor or improved mouthfeel — without compromising its inherent sensorial qualities from terroir and variety.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/panama-elida-geisha-natural-plano-0602
Ethiopia - Bombe Village Anaerobic 72 Hours,"mango, apricot, strawberry, lychee, clementine",95.00,"Description Description Producer: Daye Bensa / Asefa Dukamo KormaLocation: Sidama Variety: 74110, 74112 Process: Natural AnaerobicAltitude: 2,230 MASLCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Daye Bensa Coffee is the 2022 2nd Place Winner of the Ethiopia Cup of Excellence. Brothers Asefa and Mulugeta Dukamo started the company with one small office and a single washing station, and the vision to uplift the lives of coffee farming families in their hometown, Daye Bensa, Sidama. While the natural environment at altitudes exceeding 2000 masl was conducive to growing high-quality coffee, enabling infrastructure to process and market it did not exist. Together with his brother Mulugeta Dukamo, he would find a way to overcome this obstacle by setting up wet and dry mills at strategic locations and, not long after, their own exporting company. Now they have 71 washing stations, 11 dry mills, and three farms, with work in progress to expand to neighboring areas Guji, Bale, and West Arsi. The majestic Bombe Village situated among mountains at 2,230 masl is home to a community of nearly 700 coffee farmers who share a profound connection because of their dedication to perpetuating their heritage of cultivating excellent coffees and the determination to overcome adversity to realize their family’s aspirations through coffee. Across ancestral lines, these farmers whose families include a remarkable number of children, have committedly toiled to hone their craft. They are driven by their desire to sufficiently provide for their children and pave the way for future generations to continually enjoy an improved quality of life. With assistance from Daye Bensa, they are empowered with updated know-how to sustainably nurture their farmlands, ranging from 2 to 7 hectares, which are both their sanctuary and source of livelihood. Daye Bensa’s involvement in post-harvest processing colors every harvest season with anticipation and hope because they provide the opportunity to pool cherries into commercially viable volumes and also the facilities to optimize the flavor potential of the cherries in order to deliver better value back to the farming families. Daye Bensa Coffee is one of Ethiopia's Top 5 Coffee Exporters. They supply 7,500 tons annually to 25 countries. Unlike others, they produce their own coffee on this massive scale and operate a relationship-based model with farmers, buyers, and other producers, allowing them to directly influence and improve their coffee's quality. With Kenean Dukamo, Asefa’s son and second-generation leader, on-board, Daye Bensa looks to build on their COE win by creating a division focused on ""intentional coffees.” They are also looking at creative collaborations with outside sectors like the arts or winemaking. Archers x Daye Bensa The Archers bond with Daye Bensa goes a long way back. It's also a connection marked by exhilarating milestones, such as: Archers’ first stint at the National Brewers Cup in 2021 where our co-founder and green buyer Frederick Bejo showcased a progressive rendering of Hamasho Village on-stage; our first creative processing collaboration that brought us exclusive Hamasho 192 Hrs and Gatta Warm Anaerobic Archers lots, our inaugural learning adventure at origin when we flew to Ethiopia for the CQI Q Processing 2 The Professional at Gatta Farm, Sidama Bensa, and that epic private cupping event featuring 20 cup profiles expressed by a single Ethiopian variety processed in 20 different ways. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process ‘Ethiopian heirloom’ is the general term commonly used to identify coffee originating from Ethiopia. It covers two classifications: Jimma Agricultural Research Center (JARC) varieties and regional landrace varieties. JARC varieties were developed and released to improve the productivity and livelihood of smallholder coffee farmers and boost the country's coffee industry. They are promoted and bred because of their good quality when grown at the recommended elevations, resistance to or tolerance of adverse elements, and adaptability to diverse environments. There are 40+ JARC varieties comprised mostly of pure line selections and a handful of hybrids. Regional landraces, meanwhile, are varieties that propagate in the wild, without regulated interventions. 74110 and 74112 are JARC varieties whose combined flavor potential we have grown familiar with in our years of working with Daye Bensa. Archers has offered Bombe Village Natural in 2021 and 2022. 2021 had tasting notes of mandarin orange, apricot, strawberry, and caramel, while 2022 had orange, apricot, pineapple, mixed berries, and floral honey. In both years, the crops consistently showcased a sweet, succulent, and pleasantly tart apricot note alongside prominent sweetness — caramel in 2021 and floral honey in 2022. While both years showcased diversely aromatic and fruit-forward qualities, 2022 had a wider spectrum that included berries, citrus, and tropical fruit notes, as well as some florality. The natural-processed crop has turned out to be a surprise stunner, with the heightened aromatics of serenely floral lavender and invigorating lemongrass — both of which had not been there before — intertwined with mouthwatering nectarine and the creamy sweetness of papaya. But, it is this 72-hour Natural Anaerobic lot that has nostalgically brought back the distinct apricot note that characterized Bombe Village in 2021 and 2022, along with the strawberry that was also present in 2021. The natural anaerobic process gave way to this fantastic frenzy of fruit that unfurls on the palate as a playful composition that now includes mango, lychee, and clementine notes.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-bombe-village-anaerobic-72-hours

Their activities aim to honor every facet of coffee by producing exclusive and outstanding nano-lots. They do this by using the highest quality cherries cultivated and harvested by the smallholder farmers in the proximate communities and processing them through contemporary updates to traditional methods and styles. They named their company “Elto” which, we learned from Atiklit, means “more than passion” and “abundance” in the Sidamic language. Their aspiration is for every Elto coffee to be the most exciting cup a consumer has ever tasted. Guided by the values of honesty, respect, and humility to always remain open to learning, they are committed to engaging in meaningful relationships with their connections throughout the value chain, fostering a spirit of dynamic creativity in the industry, and showcasing the Elto rendition of Sidama Bensa coffees to the world. They consider their greatest task to be empowering their partner coffee farmers through more rewarding returns for their assiduous work. The Arbegona district made headlines in 2022 when a natural-processed 74158 variety from one of its villages ranked 1st in the Ethiopia Cup of Excellence. The coffee-growing communities here are nestled among the highest elevations in Sidama Bensa, where the ideal conditions for cultivating coffee cherries of the highest quality coalesce. As customary in the country, the 500 - 750 smallholder coffee farmers in Arbegona Village, each tending to 1-2 hectare plots, follow traditional farm practices making their coffees inherently organic, while the beneficial microclimate and healthy soils encourage more sugars to develop. By selectively handpicking, they preserve the integrity of each cherry and avoid harming the coffee trees. With Eliyas and Atiklit’s involvement, it has become possible to fully explore the flavor potential and optimize the value of their harvests, which they had not been able to previously due to limited know-how on updated cultivation and post-harvest processing best practices. Eliyas and Atiklit are seasoned specialty coffee professionals with grassroots working experience complementing their solid academic backgrounds. Both of them are professional cuppers trained by the Ethiopian Tea and Coffee Authority. Eliyas, who graduated with a Bsc in Marketing Management has taken the lead in Daye Bensa Coffee as Operations Manager. Meanwhile Atiklit, who graduated with a BSc in Agriculture focused on Plant Science, has built her career so far by working in Gesha Village as Coffee Processing Manager and in Daye Bensa as Lab Manager for Microlot Processing at harvest time.

Sidama Bensa-grown 74158, a JARC variety generally observed to express Geisha-esque floral, citrus, and honeyed notes, has consistently ranked among the best at the Ethiopia Cup of Excellence and fetched the highest prices at the auction. For this lot, the perfectly ripe, hand-harvested, and carefully pre-cleaned cherries were placed directly onto the raised beds in even layers to sun-dry. A majority of women processing workers stirred the cherries every 30 minutes to facilitate uniform drying. The cherries spent a total of 15 to 18 days in the drying phase until the target moisture level was reached.

"Panama - Spectrum, Savage Coffees","white florals, peach, papaya, honey, sugarcane",285.00,"Description Description Producer: Jamison Savage / Savage CoffeesLocation: Boquete, Chiriqui, PanamaVariety: Green Tip GeishaProcess: Washed Carbonic MacerationAltitude: 1700-1800 MASLCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Jamison Savage of Finca Deborah, Iris Estate, and Savage Coffees is known throughout the specialty coffee world due to his pioneering methods. Engaged in progressive processing techniques and farming practices respectful of nature, Jamison lets the most favorable, naturally occurring sensory nuances of a coffee shine on the palate. It’s a feat accomplished by few and evidently appreciated worldwide, as national and world coffee competitors frequently choose to showcase his coffees. 2016 saw his prowess shine brighter when Taiwan’s Berg Wu won the World Barista Championship using a Geisha from Finca Deborah. Since then, numerous national champions have entrusted Jamison to design coffees for their routines on the world stage. Among them are our very own WBrC representative David Disuanco and France's Charity Cheung. It was in the early 2000s when Jamison, at the height of his finance career in the US, decided a change was in order. He longed for a freer lifestyle to give himself and his family a chance to spend more time outdoors and to travel. At the same time, he was looking for a real estate asset to fill a gap in his investment portfolio. In our 2022 Producer’s Talk, Jamison shared that they were choosing between Panama and New Zealand. Panama eventually won out for practical reasons and the sheer beauty and promise of the land. Their deliberation and preparation took about five years and culminated in 2008, the year the Savage family uprooted and started anew on foreign soil. They made their new home in the Volcan region of the Chiriqui province, the seat of Panama Geisha cultivation and home to Finca Deborah, Iris Estate, and Savage Coffees. Savage Coffees is a collaboration between Jamison Savage and boutique coffee producers in the highlands of Boquete Valley and Volcan, Chiriqui — also known as Panama’s Valley of Flowers and Eternal Spring. The community’s heritage expertise is built on generations of deep commitment to quality and close attention to detail. Paired with years of disciplined experimentation, Savage Coffees have consistently delivered podium-finishing coffees reflecting the land's natural character. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Spectrum started with the harvest of perfectly ripe Green Tip Geisha cherries at levels of 21-24 on the BRIX meter. These cherries were twice sorted and selected before being deposited into hermetically sealed, stainless steel tanks, where they remained for upwards of 100 hours. During this period, CO2 was introduced at regular intervals amid a controlled and regulated fermentation environment. This was also the time the coffee seeds could absorb high fruit notes and finer aromatics from the cherry itself. Temperature and PH were monitored throughout this duration, ensuring these variables stayed within pre-defined limits. Following their extended stay inside the sealed tanks, the cherries were removed and then washed. For the drying phase, the washed cherries were laid out on the three-tiered, raised African bed system designed by Jamison situated within shaded drying areas, also referred to as dry houses. Throughout this phase, temperatures, humidity, and airflow were closely monitored and regulated, as the cherries were consistently and carefully shifted throughout the day for even drying. The cherries spent around 10 days on the drying beds before reaching the proper moisture level of approximately 11%. To protect the quality that had painstakingly been created, they were then bagged in Grain-pro and stored under optimal conditions of cool and stable temperatures for a reposo or seasoning process critical in Jamison's stringent end-to-end QC protocol. In reposo, the coffee's moisture content stabilized while allowing it to keep absorbing more flavor from its parchment or shell, before being hulled and further sorted by size, density, and color, and finally shipped to us. About the Panama Geisha Panama Geisha, of which Green Tip Geisha is one variation, is a rare, delicate, and complex variety well-loved for its sweet florality and citrus highlights. Since its debut win at the Best of Panama auction in 2004, it has kept specialty coffee lovers everywhere captivated by its endless possibilities, delicacy, complexity, and clarity of flavors. As such, it is often showcased on coffee competition stages by a great number of coffee champions, and it also continues to fetch the highest prices.

The Fabianis established Kawasili as a venue for natural and honey-focused post-harvest processing, intending to explore flavor diversification while contributing to environmental conservation via reduced water consumption and the prevention of potential contamination from washed-processing byproducts. The Project has enabled the farmers they work with to differentiate and get more value back for their harvests by pivoting away from traditionally known citrusy Burundian flavor profiles towards more intense and syrupy attributes. Not only do the Fabianis provide the appropriate facilities and expert oversight to facilitate purposeful processing methods that preserve the cherries’ inherent high quality and optimize their flavor potential. They also promote environmental stewardship and nurture their relationship with the farming community by sharing updated agricultural knowledge. One example is around the use of organic inputs during cultivation, which protects biodiversity and soil health while also allowing for more desirable organoleptic qualities to develop within the cherries. Growing up and having been educated and built a career in Italy but with roots in Burundi, Diane has always carried a fellow feeling for Burundian farmers and their families. The Kawasili Project is one way she and Andrea contribute to bringing a sense of ease and stability into their lives, which have so often been subject to periods of upheaval. Another way is through enhancing the community’s financial literacy, with assistance from the humanitarian non-profit organization AVSI, which Andrea is involved in. Kawasili, situated on a hill called Kivuvuma — among the picturesque, rolling terrains the country is known for — receives cherries from smallholding farmers in neighboring areas.

Even as the brothers have taken the reins, their mother, Martha Rubi remains a central figure in El Vergel. By her initiative, ""Women Project"" was formed with eight women and has now grown to 15. They carry out the critical and meticulous task of selective handpicking to ensure only properly ripe cherries go into processing. Overall, Elias and Shady's coffee development projects focus on empowering smallholder farmers in their home department, Tolima, with updated knowledge to diversify the flavor profiles their coffees can offer, leading to an increase in their crops' quality and market value. The work they do at El Vergel also serves as an example of best practices from cultivation, harvesting, and through to post-harvest processing. They also proactively connect with international specialty coffee roasters to match their own and their partners' coffees with the appropriate consumers. Through these connections, they enable the two ends of the coffee value chain to get the fullest benefit. El Vergel is a 300-hectare estate situated on an inactive volcano called Black Mountain in Fresno, Tolima. Different coffee varieties like Geisha, Pacamara, Caturra, Java, and Bourbon are grown in strategically positioned plots with nutrient rich-volcanic soil across a range of altitudes and microclimates. Their wet mill is also known as a hub for successful explorations into fermentation involving novel inputs, from fruits to microbes like Koji.

Burundi - Kivuvuma Natural,"apple, raisins, caramel, butter biscuits",50.00,"Description Description Producer: Andrea Fabiani / Diane NsengiyumvaLocation: Kayanza ProvinceVariety: MibiriziProcess: NaturalAltitude: 1,700 - 1,800 maslCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Andrea Fabiani and Diane Nsengiyumva Fabiani, both agronomic engineers, comprise the husband-and-wife team leading the Kawasili Project, a progressive coffee processing center in Gahombo Commune, Kayanza Province, which is located in Buyenzi, one of the country’s five coffee-growing regions. The Fabianis established Kawasili as a venue for natural and honey-focused post-harvest processing, intending to explore flavor diversification while contributing to environmental conservation via reduced water consumption and the prevention of potential contamination from washed-processing byproducts. The Project has enabled the farmers they work with to differentiate and get more value back for their harvests by pivoting away from traditionally known citrusy Burundian flavor profiles towards more intense and syrupy attributes. Not only do the Fabianis provide the appropriate facilities and expert oversight to facilitate purposeful processing methods that preserve the cherries’ inherent high quality and optimize their flavor potential. They also promote environmental stewardship and nurture their relationship with the farming community by sharing updated agricultural knowledge. One example is around the use of organic inputs during cultivation, which protects biodiversity and soil health while also allowing for more desirable organoleptic qualities to develop within the cherries. Growing up and having been educated and built a career in Italy but with roots in Burundi, Diane has always carried a fellow feeling for Burundian farmers and their families. The Kawasili Project is one way she and Andrea contribute to bringing a sense of ease and stability into their lives, which have so often been subject to periods of upheaval. Another way is through enhancing the community’s financial literacy, with assistance from the humanitarian non-profit organization AVSI, which Andrea is involved in. Kawasili, situated on a hill called Kivuvuma — among the picturesque, rolling terrains the country is known for — receives cherries from smallholding farmers in neighboring areas. In these parts, coffee trees grow amid ideal agroecological conditions, including elevations between 1700 to 1800 masl and an approximate average rainfall of 1650 mm. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Excepting vulnerability to leaf rust and coffee berry disease, Mibirizi is an otherwise low-maintenance, drought-tolerant variety with the potential for exceptional cup quality, which makes it an important variety for coffee growers in Burundi and neighboring Rwanda, where it is commonly cultivated. It is reported to have been introduced to East Africa from Guatemala by way of Rwanda, and is noted to have descended from Typica and then eventually mixed with plants of Bourbon lineage that were first introduced from Kenya. The natural process directed the coffee’s flavor character toward buttery caramels complemented by mild acidity, in contrast with the more common sweet yet bright quality of traditional washed Burundian Mibirizi.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/burundi-kivuvuma-natural

He is committed to honoring the legacy of his ancestors through the continued pursuit of their aim — producing excellent coffees and making the family's name known for it worldwide. To ensure consistent quality and make way for improvement every year, he is involved in every step of production, from the establishment of the coffee plants, cherry harvest, fermentation and drying, until dry milling and loading the greens into containers for export. With 200 years of heritage knowledge in coffee, Alejo is vocal about soil health as the cornerstone of cultivating coffee trees that yield cherries with well-developed beans having the potential for complex flavors. He implements only processing innovations that preserve the integrity of variety while highlighting its most desirable attributes and reflecting its provenance. Volcan Azul is the flagship estate of the Castro Kahle family. It spans 300 hectares on the slopes of the Poas Volcano, of which 60 hectares are planted, and 200 hectares are dedicated to conservation. There are 40+ varieties grown on the farm, of which Geisha, Typica, SL 28, Caturra, and San Isidro have won at the COE. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The H17 variety is a hybrid between Catuai and an Ethiopian heirloom, with the higher yield potential of the former and potential for high cup quality from the latter. In the natural process, the properly ripe cherries are singled out through Brix measurement and then selectively hand-picked. They are then pre-cleaned and sorted through flotation. The floaters are set aside and the remainder placed in tanks without depulping. The cherries are left to ferment for 24 hours, and then laid out on the drying patio. Daily for 12 to 15 days, the cherries are stirred from 8am to 2pm to ensure even drying. Depending on the actual drying conditions throughout this period, the cherries may also be layered more thickly or spread out more thinly.

"Colombia - Villa Rosita, Finca El Paraiso","passion fruit, peach iced tea, lychee, red plum",130.00,"Description Description Producer: Diego Samuel BermudezLocation: Piendamo, CaucaVariety: Castillo, F6Process: Thermal Shock NaturalAltitude: 1,900 maslCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Finca El Paraiso is the realization of one family’s dream of a coffee farm as a kind of paradise. It started to materialize in 2008 when Diego Samuel Bermudez and his family began to cultivate an assortment of traditional, novel, and exotic coffee varieties across the well-endowed and sky-reaching terrains of Vereda Los Arados, Tunía in the Piendamó municipality of the Cauca department in Colombia. It is their family’s flagship farm, spanning 49 hectares, and the headquarters of their trailblazing post-harvest processing company, INDESTEC S.A.S, shorthand for “Innovation and Technological Development for Agriculture.” This is their platform for ongoing research into and the promotion of precise and purposeful experimental methods and techniques, like the stirringly named “Thermal Shock,” intended to create a cornucopia of peerless cup profiles. Their aim — to distinguish Finca El Paraiso among the department and the nation’s accomplished and prolific producers, generate greater interest across global specialty coffee lovers, elevate the value of Cauca-grown coffees, and on the whole, contribute to continuously raising the profile and position of Colombia as an innovative and pre-eminent origin of higher-end specialty coffees. Finca El Paraiso’s location on the Pan-American route between Popayán, Cauca’s capital, and Cali, a municipality in the neighboring department Valle del Cauca, with a prevailing climate described as temperate-humid and the frequent incidence of winds from the Pacific, has been attributed for the tropical notes frequently perceived in their coffees. Meanwhile, Cauca is one of the 21 officially designated coffee-growing departments of Colombia, which was granted its “Denomination of Origin” in 2011 as a testament to the remarkable quality and distinct flavor identity of its coffees. Due to Colombia’s immense heterogeneity of microclimates, terroirs, varieties, and their resultant flavor characters, Colombia is regarded in the world of coffee as a “Land of Diversity.” When traditionally washed, Cauca coffees are generally characterized as clean, soft, and fragrant, with pronounced caramelized aromas and carrying flavors tending toward high acidity with discernible sweet and floral notes, a medium body, and a balanced overall impression. Amid this backdrop, Finca El Paraiso truly caught the specialty coffee world’s attention when Diego Samuel made it to the Top 10 of the 2018 Cup of Excellence with a double anaerobic Bourbon, and again counted among the 2019 winners with a washed anaerobic Castillo. Five years on from their first COE accolade and 15 years after Finca El Paraiso’s founding, the family emblem Finca Paraiso has come to encompass six more farms — Villa Rosita, Villa Alejandro, Villa Esperanza, Sur, El Rubi, and El Manizales — and their family’s dream continues to prosper while empowering the communities they work with to succeed. They do this through INDESTEC’s six action pillars — Technology, Knowledge Management, Collaboration, Sustainable Marketing, Resource Management, and Rural Alliances. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Castillo and F6 are cultivars introduced by Colombia’s national coffee research institute, Cenicafe, to mitigate the risk of debilitating productivity declines in the event of a coffee disease epidemic. F6, also known as Colombia, comes from generations of mixing Catimors. It was released in the early 1980s and has been more known for its resistance to leaf rust than its cup quality. Castillo, meanwhile, was developed as an improvement from F6 and another cultivar, Tabi (circa 2002), in terms of resilience, productivity, and cup quality. Generally, Castillo had been observed to cup as dominantly chocolatey and cherry-like with touches of citrus. For a time, there was a popular, unfavorable sentiment around hybrids’ potential to cup well in comparison to older varieties like Caturra. It was in that context socially conscious and innovative producers like Diego Samuel Bermudez pursued post-harvest processing experiments intending to illustrate that the resilience and productivity of hybrid varieties like F6 and Castillo can go hand-in-hand with good, even exceptional, cup quality. This served to increase awareness among Colombian coffee farmers that they can reduce their risk of loss by planting disease-resistant varieties while remaining confident that their coffees can cup competitively and thus be valued at a premium. On top of that, their successful experiments would open up numerous trajectories for creating a diversity of unique flavor profiles, augmenting opportunities for the farmers to be better rewarded for their hard work. Finca El Paraiso and INDESTEC's ingenuity lies in having thoroughly studied, implemented, and documented their simultaneously structured and creative processing methods and techniques at such a high level of granularity that allows for consistent repeatability of their approaches and effectively unconstrains their potential to increase the diversity of probable flavor profiles, depending on the customers' preferences, varieties on hand, and the prevailing terroir conditions at the time of processing. To consistently achieve the desired cup profiles, precision in configuring the different processing parameters at every significant phase is a hallmark of harvesting, sorting, fermentation, and drying at Finca El Paraiso. In this micro-lot, coffee cherries were harvested at the optimum point of ripeness and then pre-cleaned and sorted by removing leaves, branches, and other impurities, followed by flotation to facilitate the selection of the most optimal cherries, and disinfection with ozone to remove extraneous microbiological load before proceeding to 72-hour anaerobic fermentation submerged in water, with native yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. Thermal Shock was applied by quickly turning up the temperature of the fermentation fluids, rapidly opening up the membranes and pores of the coffee beans and facilitating the attachment of the abundant aroma and flavor precursors in the fermentation medium to them, and immediately subjecting the cherries to a drastic drop in temperature, sealing the coffee beans’ pores, locking the aroma and flavor precursors in. As for the crucial drying phase, Finca El Paraiso’s custom drying and dehumidifying technology was used. It was designed with consideration to the usually highly volatile and thermolabile compounds generated during fermentation and genetically inherent in the coffees. As such, it removes moisture by mass transfer, allowing the drying phase to be accomplished without high temperatures, making way for a less abrupt transition to seed dormancy. This, in effect, permits the coffee to be stored for extended periods without the risk of presenting quality defects and guarantees the highest possible quality of the final green coffee.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/colombia-villa-rosita-finca-el-paraiso
Guatemala - Pacamara Finca Cuxinales,"cherry, plums, guava, chocolate, round, and creamy",62.00,"Description Description Producer: Pedro Echeverria / Raul RodasLocation: Antigua, Ciudad ViejaProcess: Natural AnaerobicAltitude: 1500 – 1800 MASLVariety: Pacamara Crop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Finca Cuxinales is located in the highlands of Antigua, one of the famous coffee-growing regions in Guatemala. Its unique microclimate is attributed to the three volcanoes in its vicinity — Acatenango, Agua, and Fuego. Eruptions from Volcan Fuego contribute to the volcanic sand and ash comprising the land, which is deep, porous, and well-draining. These make the soil conducive to the prolific growth of the Pacamara, Bourbon, Caturra, Catuai, and Pache varieties cultivated at the farm. Pedro Echeverria has been managing Finca Cuxinales for more than 25 years, mainly producing washed coffees as customary in Guatemala’s long history of coffee production. In the last three years, he has successfully implemented natural and anaerobic processing techniques. The Exporter Raul Rodas, founder of Paradigma Coffee Trading and the roastery Paradigma Coffee, is a four-time Guatemala National Barista Champion and the World Barista Champion in 2012. The span and scope of his coffee journey have given him a thorough understanding of what must be done at key points in the specialty coffee value chain to create a remarkable experience for the consumer to enjoy their cup. He has also established relationships with meticulous and forward-thinking producers across the known and upcoming coffee-growing regions in the country. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Pacamara is a crossbreed of the Maragopipe and Pacas varieties, characterized by very large bean size and potential for exceptional cup quality. It has also been observed to carry a diverse array of flavors which can be revealed through thoughtful processing. By collaborating with Raul Rodas of Paradigma Coffee, Pedro has brought out the tropical and stone fruit nuances of the Pacamara alongside a chocolatey character and buttery mouthfeel. In his previous experiences, it would usually exhibit more sweet, caramel notes typically associated with Antigua coffees. This specific Pacamara lot underwent seven days of anaerobic fermentation to increase fruitiness in the cup and achieve a fuller body. The 16 days of patio drying with some shade allowed the desired sweetness to emerge.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/guatemala-pacamara-finca-cuxinales
Rwanda - Musha Lot N90,"blueberry, caramelized dates, dark plum, bakers chocolate",55.00,"Description Description Producer: Baho Coffee / Emmanuel RusatiraLocation: Rwamagana DistrictVariety: Red BourbonProcess: Natural AnaerobicAltitude: 1600 MASLCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Emmanuel Rusatira founded Baho Coffee, intending to help to improve the livelihood of small coffee farmers in Rwanda. His empathy for their life struggles stems from having been born into a smallholding coffee-farming family himself. He came to a deeper understanding of the material challenges they face throughout his years directly working with them as a coffee washing station manager and realized the true extent of their plight when he oversaw upwards of 30 washing stations across the country when he was working as a Department Head of Specialty, Sustainability, and Certification. The foundations for a quality-focused coffee industry established by the Rwandese government to revive the nation after the 1994 genocide —where Emmanuel lost his parents and brother — served not only as a source of hope for survivors like him but also served as the solid ground upon which they could rebuild their lives. Emmanuel decided that the evocative Rwandese word ""baho,"" literally meaning ""have life,"" best captures and conveys his company's reason for being — which is for his smallholding coffee farmer partners to have better lives. 546 smallholder farmers bring their harvest to the Musha Washing Station, which is located in Eastern Rwanda, adjacent to the capital city of Kigali. It is one of the 11 washing stations in Rwamagana that have been rehabilitated as part of their District Development Strategy from 2018 to 2024, which aims to increase citizens' quality of life through increased production of lucrative crops like coffee. Farmers that deliver to Musha are recognized and rewarded by Baho Coffee for providing high-quality cherries to the washing station through premium prices and a second, bonus payment. On top of that, the company extends educational, financial, and agricultural services to these farmers and has set up several social programs focused on more marginalized segments within the farming community, like women, the elderly, and the youth. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Bourbon is the only variety that made it to the Cup of Excellence the last time the auction was conducted in Rwanda. This points to Bourbon’s propensity for taking in the best qualities of terroir, which then translate into desirable qualities in the cup. Amid a dominantly washed process-oriented industry, Emmanuel sought to be one of the pioneers of natural and honey processing in Rwanda after visiting Costa Rica, where he witnessed how these methods could multiply the trajectories of flavor creation. He applied this learning in Baho to widen their coffees’ range of flavors beyond the usual associations with the bold brightness of classic Kenyans and hints of Ethiopian florality. This micro-lot went through the natural anaerobic process to bring out intense, sticky sweetness alongside a rich chocolate character that is balanced by a discreet, barely there acidity. At Baho Coffee, the initial steps to process cherries are standardized. It starts with a day of intensive sorting in full shade to ensure only the ripest of cherries picked not more than 2 to 3 hours prior, and without any visible defects, proceed to the next steps. The sorted cherries are then floated in a large container, whereby the floaters are removed, and only the densest ones go into processing as higher-grade lots. In this case, the densest cherries were fermented in sealed containers after sorting, to amplify the sugars and soften acidity. Then, they were placed directly on drying beds within a custom-built parabolic drying facility, akin to a greenhouse, to protect them from rain and too much sunlight. This drying phase can last from 50 to 55 days. During this period, the cherries are layered singly with a maximum depth of 2 to 4 cm and turned hourly for the first five days, and then every two hours until day 20. The ambient temperature and that of the coffee are closely monitored to control the pace of drying with the intention of keeping it slow. By recording temperature and moisture at regular intervals daily, the processing team can adjust their activities accordingly whenever key drying indicators fall outside the target thresholds. For example, workers might shift the cherries more frequently or cover them with a mesh, or both, to prevent over-fermentation and the formation of molds, which would otherwise turn up in the cup as undesirable flavors indicative of defects. The drying phase ends upon reaching a moisture content of 11%, at which point the coffee in dried cherry is packed and kept in a dry warehouse until it needs to be milled.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/rwanda-musha-lot-n90

Their activities aim to honor every facet of coffee by producing exclusive and outstanding nano-lots. They do this by using the highest quality cherries cultivated and harvested by the smallholder farmers in the proximate communities and processing them through contemporary updates to traditional methods and styles. They named their company “Elto” which, we learned from Atiklit, means “more than passion” and “abundance” in the Sidamic language. Their aspiration is for every Elto coffee to be the most exciting cup a consumer has ever tasted. Guided by the values of honesty, respect, and humility to always remain open to learning, they are committed to engaging in meaningful relationships with their connections throughout the value chain, fostering a spirit of dynamic creativity in the industry, and showcasing the Elto rendition of Sidama Bensa coffees to the world. They consider their greatest task to be empowering their partner coffee farmers through more rewarding returns for their assiduous work. Gango Village is situated in the well-endowed Sidama Bensa highlands at 2,300 masl, neighboring more widely renowned higher-end specialty coffee cultivating communities like Hamasho Village and Bombe Village. The village was named Gango in recognition of a domestic equine hybrid of the same name in Sidamic language. The Gango are held in high regard because they embody the best traits of both the horse and the donkey— being hardier, longer-lived, and more patient than a horse, and less obstinate and more intelligent than a donkey. Gango Village is home to about 600 smallholder coffee farmers who grow inherently organic, sugar-rich, and high-quality coffee cherries inter-cropped with banana and enset, as the most common source of sustenance, in 1-2 hectare parcels of land. They harvest coffee cherries by selective handpicking, avoiding any harm to both each cherries and the trees, but had been unable to fully explore the flavor potential and optimize the value of these cherries, due to limited know-how on updated cultivation and post-harvest processing best practices until Eliyas and Atiklit shared their expertise. Eliyas and Atiklit are seasoned specialty coffee professionals with grassroots working experience complementing their solid academic backgrounds. Both of them are professional cuppers trained by the Ethiopian Tea and Coffee Authority. Eliyas, who graduated with a BSc in Marketing Management has taken the lead in Daye Bensa Coffee as Operations Manager. Meanwhile Atiklit, who graduated with a BSc in Agriculture focused on Plant Science, has built her career so far by working in Gesha Village as Coffee Processing Manager and in Daye Bensa as Lab Manager for Microlot Processing at harvest time. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process ‘Ethiopian heirloom’ is the general term commonly used to identify coffee originating from Ethiopia. It covers two classifications: Jimma Agricultural Research Center (JARC) varieties and regional landrace varieties. JARC varieties were developed and released to improve the productivity and livelihood of smallholder coffee farmers, to boost the country's coffee industry. These varieties are promoted and bred because of their good quality (when grown at the recommended elevations), resistance to or tolerance of adverse elements, and adaptability to diverse environmental conditions. There are 40+ JARC varieties comprised mostly of pure line selections and a handful of hybrids. Regional landraces, meanwhile, are varieties that propagate in the wild, without regulated interventions. Sidama Bensa-grown 74158, a JARC variety generally observed to express Geisha-esque floral, citrus, and honeyed notes, has consistently ranked among the best at the Ethiopia Cup of Excellence and fetched the highest prices at the auction. The Archers Lot Archers Lots culminate our co-founders’ creativity and technical acumen to compose truly artisanal specialty coffee experiences for both the discerning and adventurous specialty coffee connoisseurs, in collaboration with our closest producing partners. In this Archers-curated 48-hour natural anaerobic process, the perfectly ripe, hand-harvested, and carefully pre-cleaned cherries were re-sorted on raised beds to ensure uniformity of the ripeness level (visually indicated by color) before being placed in 50-60 KG plastic barrels and then sealed with lids having a one-way valve — to aid in maintaining an oxygen-free fermentation phase throughout the pre-determined 48-hour period. After this, the barrels were emptied onto the raised beds, as the whole cherries were evenly spread out in very thin layers, allowing the fermentation juices to sufficiently drain off of them. The specific instruction to maintain very thinly layered cherries throughout the sun-drying phase was deliberate, to avoid extraneous microbial activity as the coffees had already undergone the necessary fermentation in the barrels prior. The target moisture level was achieved after 18 to 21 days. As a result of this process, this cup expresses a dainty balance of florals, intense and multi-faceted sweetness with a touch of tropicality, with complex acidities from pome, stone, and tropical fruits and berries, as well as an enhanced, creamy mouthfeel.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-elto-archers-lot-natural

Brothers Asefa and Mulugeta Dukamo started the company with one small office and a single washing station, and the vision to uplift the lives of coffee farming families in their hometown, Daye Bensa, Sidama. While the natural environment at altitudes exceeding 2000 masl was conducive to growing high-quality coffee, enabling infrastructure to process and market it did not exist. Together with his brother Mulugeta Dukamo, he would find a way to overcome this obstacle by setting up wet and dry mills at strategic locations and, not long after, their own exporting company. Now they have 71 washing stations, 11 dry mills, and three farms, with work in progress to expand to neighboring areas Guji, Bale, and West Arsi. Hundreds of smallholder farmers in the Bombe Mountains of Sidama Bensa comprise Hamasho Village, where the craft of coffee cultivation is built on generations of endurance and experience. Since they traditionally drink their own coffee, they have an instinct for what high-quality tastes like. The name Hamasho is Sidamic for snake, a cultural symbol of strength that also holds spiritual significance. With the efforts of Daye Bensa Coffee to enhance this knowledge, Hamasho Village farmers are able to maintain and even raise their crops’ quality and commercial viability. Every 50-100 partner farmers regularly receive information about healthy cultivation practices from a dedicated contact. Daye Bensa Coffee is one of Ethiopia's Top 5 Coffee Exporters. They supply 7,500 tons annually to 25 countries. Unlike others, they produce their own coffee on this massive scale and operate a relationship-based model with farmers, buyers, and other producers, allowing them to directly influence and improve their coffee's quality. With Kenean Dukamo, Asefa’s son and second-generation leader, on-board, Daye Bensa looks to build on their COE win by creating a division focused on ""intentional coffees.” They are also looking at creative collaborations with outside sectors like the arts or winemaking. Archers x Daye Bensa The Archers bond with Daye Bensa goes a long way back. It's also a connection marked by exhilarating milestones, such as: Archers’ first stint at the National Brewers Cup in 2021 where our co-founder and green buyer Frederick Bejo showcased a progressive rendering of Hamasho Village on-stage; our first creative processing collaboration that brought us exclusive Hamasho 192 Hrs and Gatta Warm Anaerobic Archers lots, our inaugural learning adventure at origin when we flew to Ethiopia for the CQI Q Processing 2 The Professional at Gatta Farm, Sidama Bensa, and that epic private cupping event featuring 20 cup profiles expressed by a single Ethiopian variety processed in 20 different ways.

The move was a definite game-changer that gave them control over quality and the capacity to be creative to experiment and maximize the flavor potential of the coffees grown on their farm and their neighbors’. Brunca is one of the eight coffee-growing regions identified by the country’s national coffee institute, ICAFE. It is dubbed the last frontier in the ICAFE publication Cafe de Costa Rica: Spirit of a Nation because it is the most remote of all the eight. Within it, the Chirripó micro-region has been gaining renown as a specialty coffee origin due to its terroir. Located between the country’s two highest mountains, Cerro de la Muerte (3.491m.) and Cerro Chirripó (3.820m.), coffee farms in this area sit at high altitudes from 1300 to 2000 masl and benefit from the rich soils and biodiverse natural environment. All of these contribute to the unique microclimates that allow coffee trees to grow well and produce healthy cherries that capture the myriad flavors of the land. The remarkable quality of Chirripó coffee had been recognized at the Cup of Excellence, when a honey-processed Caturra produced by Café Rivense ranked 5th in the 2019 competition. This recognition encouraged an increase in land planted with coffee and the cultivation of different varieties in the Chirripó micro-region, which is projected to continue for years ahead. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Catuai was introduced to the Brunca region during Costa Rica’s green revolution, along with the latest varieties and agricultural practices at the time. It was created to increase productivity and facilitate easier harvesting by cross-breeding the compact Caturra and the high-yielding Mundo Novo. The Ureña Rojas family’s focus on traceability through micro-lots enables innovation in post-harvest processing at Café Rivense. The micro-lot system allows them to identify and associate which particular varieties, such as Catuai, grown in which specific microclimates across the farm, express their best qualities when processed in a certain way. Since micro-lot information is shared when marketing their coffees, consumer feedback can be tied back to the micro-lot and support Café Rivense in learning about the market’s preferences and modifying aspects of their production accordingly. Incorporating anaerobics into the black honey process revealed a deeper dimension of this Café Rivense Catuai, with a tropical nuance and a winey character.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/costa-rica-el-jardin-anaerobic
"Colombia - Condor, Decaf","berries, caramel, peach, cinnamon",65.00,"Description Description Producer: Elias & Shady Bayter / El Vergel EstateLocation: Piedra Grande, TolimaVariety: Caturra Process: Sugarcane EAAltitude: 1,500 maslCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer El Vergel is a Q-processed single estate on an inactive volcano named Black Mountain in Tolima. It is operated by brothers Elias and Shady Bayter, who believe experimental processes are “The New Way of Coffee.” With farmlands heavy in nutrient rich soil and sitting at an elevation of 1,500 masl, coffee tree varieties grow healthy and yield good quality cherries. At the right season, these are inspected by tenured pickers, and only the properly ripe ones are harvested by hand. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process When the Bayter brothers observed that only low quality coffee was being used to make decaf, they decided to produce a specialty version using El Vergel Caturra. They found this variety could retain the coffee’s innate sweetness, after going through Sugar Cane Ethyl Acetate processing, commonly called “natural decaffeinated.” The ethyl acetate is the result of combining acetate with the ethanol from fermenting molasses that come from sugarcanes abundant in Colombia. This is an innovative and economic way for such readily available resource to complement the coffee industry. In this process, the coffee is first exposed to water and steam, increasing moisture content and expanding the beans. This facilitates caffeine extraction, which is done by washing them in the ethyl acetate, causing the caffeine to dissolve. Water and steam are again used, to clean the beans including the innermost parts. After, they are dried until moisture is similar to the level prior to processing. All throughout, there is no excessive heat or pressure applied and the beans’ cellular structure largely stays intact. Since the beans’ pores open up due to steaming though, this coffee — as greens and roasted — tends to age quicker than the regular.

Ethiopia - Gute Village,"mandarine, jasmine, white grapes, rooibos tea",75.00,"Description Description Producer: Tamiru Tadesse / Alo CoffeeLocation: Gute Village, Bensa, SidamaVariety: 74158 Process: NaturalAltitude: 2,380 maslCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Only a year into establishing Alo Coffee Export Plc, Tamiru Tadesse had already managed to foster a commendable reputation among specialty coffee connoisseurs around the world, with a burgeoning client base across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In 2021 Tamiru won 1st Place at the Ethiopia Cup of Excellence & advanced closer toward his goal of bringing greater recognition and rewards to Sidama Bensa coffee farmers, whose hard work and dedication make top-quality coffees possible. Six years working in coffee, Sidama Bensa-born Tamiru saw the great disconnect between the exceptional flavors and high cup quality potential of his hometown's coffees and the way these were being undervalued across the market. It was also too clear to him how this put the smallholder coffee-growing families and the country's coffee industry at a huge disadvantage. A friend of Tamiru winning the 2020 Ethiopia Cup of Excellence inspired him to personally contribute to a solution by starting his company, Alo Coffee. Through Alo Coffee, he is able to provide the means for smallholders to process their laboriously cultivated, inherently organic, and flavor-rich coffee cherries into distinctive lots of the highest quality, and then match them with the specialty coffee communities that recognize their value and properly reward it. Gute Village is a community of smallholder coffee farmers where each family tends to arable lands covering an area of no more than 1-2 hectares each. These family farms, which had been granted by the government, are their primary source of income and food. Across generations, these lands are typically subdivided among inheritors. On their own, each family and the community do not have the most current knowhow and sufficient resources to increase the yield of their harvests, nor to preserve and enhance the quality of the soils as well as that of their coffee cherries post-harvest. The involvement of quality-oriented and eco-socially committed specialty coffee producers like Alo Coffee contributes to alleviating the livelihood of the coffee-farming families, such as in Gute Village. To immediately benefit the smallholder coffee growers, Alo Coffee purchases their coffee cherries at a significant premium that provides a decent income to cover household essentials and their children’s education-related expenses. With a view for the longer term, Alo Coffee also provides direct assistance to the smallholder farmers through knowledge-sharing around improved practices in agronomy, cultivation, farm maintenance, and harvesting, while sponsoring community development projects such as building schools in the communities within their scope. Further, by taking charge of post-harvest processing, Alo Coffee unburdens the smallholders of the related risks and costs, enabling them to focus their attention and energy on maintaining the natural, unblemished condition of the land and looking after their coffee trees to ensure they flourish. By association with Tamiru and Alo Coffee, coffee-growing communities like Alo Village also have a better chance of their concerns and interests being acknowledged, advanced, and addressed by influential stakeholders across the industry. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process ‘Ethiopian heirloom’ is the general term commonly used to identify coffee originating from Ethiopia. It covers two classifications: Jimma Agricultural Research Center (JARC) varieties and regional landrace varieties. JARC varieties were developed and released to improve the productivity and livelihood of smallholder coffee farmers, to boost the country's coffee industry. These varieties are promoted and bred because of their good quality (when grown at the recommended elevations), resistance to or tolerance of adverse elements, and adaptability to diverse environmental conditions. There are 40+ JARC varieties comprised mostly of pure line selections and a handful of hybrids. Regional landraces, meanwhile, are varieties that propagate in the wild, without regulated interventions.

He is committed to honoring the legacy of his ancestors through the continued pursuit of their aim — producing excellent coffees and making the family's name known for it worldwide. To ensure consistent quality and make way for improvement every year, he is involved in every step of production, from the establishment of the coffee plants, cherry harvest, fermentation and drying, until dry milling and loading the greens into containers for export. With 200 years of heritage knowledge in coffee, Alejo is vocal about soil health as the cornerstone of cultivating coffee trees that yield cherries with well-developed beans having the potential for complex flavors. He implements only processing innovations that preserve the integrity of variety while highlighting its most desirable attributes and reflecting its provenance. Volcan Azul is the flagship estate of the Castro Kahle family. It spans 300 hectares on the slopes of the Poas Volcano, of which 60 hectares are planted, and 200 hectares are dedicated to conservation. There are 40+ varieties grown on the farm, of which Geisha, Typica, SL 28, Caturra, and San Isidro have won at the COE. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Typica is one of the original varieties grown at the Castro Kahles’ estates. Because of its potential for very good cup quality, producers, such as Volcan Azul, dedicate plots for its cultivation in spite of the tendency for lower yields and susceptibility to adverse elements. It is generally known to cup as a straightforward, clean, crisp, and sweet coffee. Through the Warm Anaerobic process, aromatic floral hints and fruity qualities were brought out, along with an enhanced body. The cherries were placed in sealed tanks smaller than the standard used for their other anaerobically processed lots.

Yemen - Mohamed Ali Moh. Al Suhami,"apricot, dried dates, cola, black cherry",175.00,"Description Description Producer: Mohamed Ali Moh. Al Suhami / Sheba CoffeeLocation: Bait Al Qanees, HarazVariety: JadiProcess: Natural AnaerobicAltitude: 2000 MASLCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Constantly beset by challenges beyond their control — from socio-economic upheavals to environmental constraints — Yemen's coffee-farming families persevere in perpetuating their forefathers' agricultural heritage. They resiliently tend to coffee trees that grow across terraces clinging to the steep and arid yet fertile highland terrains, like in the picturesque Haraz region in the Sana'a Governorate. Their cherries capture singularly extraordinary, sweet, and nuanced notes not found elsewhere, and coffee is their primary, if not only, source of livelihood. Haraz, at the forefront of Yemeni specialty coffee production, is known for its peerless landscapes. It is endearingly referred to as ""the land above the clouds"" because of its high elevation amid the Sarat mountain range, which is home to Jabal An-Nabi Shu’ayb, the highest mountain in the peninsula, and the critically endangered Arabian Leopard. Apart from the high altitudes, its location — some 150 km inland from the Red Sea’s primary port of Al-Hudaydah, parallel to the eastern coast of the Red Sea and with the Gulf of Aiden to the south — also contributes to the beneficial microclimates of the region. Due to its arduous topography, Haraz has remained beyond the reach of nonconstructive outside influences. As such, their people have been able to preserve their unique, indigenous culture — most evident in the architecture dating back to the Sulajhid dynasty in the 11th century — as well as their ancient cultivation traditions. Situated in the town of Bait Al Qanees at 2,000 masl, 46-year-old Mohamed Ali Moh. Al Suhami’s farm has the distinction of being among the highest in the area. While coffee is the primary crop, the farm also grows a selection of vegetables for their household’s consumption. Owing to the beneficial microclimatic conditions and the dedicated involvement of his family, Mohamed is able to produce private auction-quality coffees that express unique flavor profiles reflecting their terroir, while also continuing his career as a teacher. Recognizing the value of their coffee, not only as a means of livelihood but as a vessel for the continuity of their forefathers’ heritage, Mohamed’s older teenage children accompany him in the hard work of ensuring the well-being of their farm and the vitality of their coffee trees, to improve yields and encourage the optimum health of their crops. Integral to their labor-intensive activities are an ox and two cows that plow the land and provide a ready supply of organic fertilizer. To bring recognition and better opportunities to coffee farmers like Mohamed, Sheba Coffee was founded in 2019 by members of the Yemeni diaspora committed to harnessing their resources and connections to foster a stable and flourishing Yemeni coffee sector. Their ultimate aim is to help bring ease to Yemeni farmers’ lives and establish unshakeable roots of stability by strengthening their capacity to sustainably produce excellent coffees, whose value is highly regarded and materially rewarded by specialty coffee connoisseurs worldwide. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Jadi is one of the numerous vernacular names used to identify Yemeni coffee varieties. It is associated with coffee trees in the Sana’a Governorate, with wavy leaves and whose cherries are clustered closely together. It is lesser known than the most widely recognized Udaini variety, prominently associated with coffees from the Ibb Governorate. The discrete identity and specific attributes of coffees referred to as Jadi, along with the array of Yemeni varieities, have yet to be determined according to a recent 2022 MDPI Agronomy study. In the experience of Sheba Coffee working with Haraz-grown cherries, Jadi flavor profiles are inclined toward complex acidity and high sweetness, rich berry, and dried fruit nuances, accompanied by a winey character. For this nano-lot, Mohamed and his family selectively hand-picked the reddest cherries, passing each tree multiple times every week during the harvest season to make sure the cherries are picked only at the desired ripeness level. They plucked the cherries off the trees gently and with utmost care to ensure the quality of each cherry was not compromised and that the coffee plants remained unharmed in order to protect its potential yield in subsequent seasons. These perfectly ripe cherries were then transported to Sheba’s processing center, where they were cleaned and sorted, by way of flotation, before they being taken further into the post-harvest processing steps of fermentation and drying. In this case, fermentation was done first by placing the cherries in hermetic bags for a brief duration and then interrupting the anaerobic fermentation by taking the cherries out of the bags and transferring them to a greenhouse for a similar amount of time. By suspending the anaerobic fermentation in this way, Sheba Coffee was able to enhance the coffee’s distinct cup profile. The cherries were then placed back into the hermetic bags for another short duration to continue the anaerobic fermentation. After that, they were returned to the greenhouse — already twice fermented — in order to slow-dry before finally being taken to raised beds to dry directly under the sun. During the two to three-week drying phase, the cherries were regularly turned to stabilize moisture and ensure consistent ventilation, leading to even drying and consequently only desirable sensorial attributes in the cup.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/yemen-mohamed-ali-moh-al-suhami

Their activities aim to honor every facet of coffee by producing exclusive and outstanding nano-lots. They do this by using the highest quality cherries cultivated and harvested by the smallholder farmers in the proximate communities and processing them through contemporary updates to traditional methods and styles. They named their company “Elto” which, we learned from Atiklit, means “more than passion” and “abundance” in the Sidamic language. Their aspiration is for every Elto coffee to be the most exciting cup a consumer has ever tasted. Guided by the values of honesty, respect, and humility to always remain open to learning, they are committed to engaging in meaningful relationships with their connections throughout the value chain, fostering a spirit of dynamic creativity in the industry, and showcasing the Elto rendition of Sidama Bensa coffees to the world. They consider their greatest task to be empowering their partner coffee farmers through more rewarding returns for their assiduous work. Gango Village is situated in the well-endowed Sidama Bensa highlands at 2,300 masl, neighboring more widely renowned higher-end specialty coffee cultivating communities like Hamasho Village and Bombe Village. Likewise, it is home to about 600 smallholder coffee farmers who grow inherently organic, sugar-rich, and high-quality coffee cherries inter-cropped with banana and enset, as the most common source of sustenance, in 1-2 hectare parcels of land. They harvest coffee cherries by selective handpicking, avoiding any harm to both cherries and the trees, but had been unable to fully explore the flavor potential and optimize the value of these cherries, due to limited know-how on updated cultivation and post-harvest processing best practices until Eliyas and Atiklit shared their expertise. Eliyas and Atiklit are seasoned specialty coffee professionals with grassroots working experience complementing their solid academic backgrounds. Both of them are professional cuppers trained by the Ethiopian Tea and Coffee Authority. Eliyas, who graduated with a Bsc in Marketing Management has taken the lead in Daye Bensa Coffee as Operations Manager. Meanwhile Atiklit, who graduated with a BSc in Agriculture focused on Plant Science, has built her career so far by working in Gesha Village as Coffee Processing Manager and in Daye Bensa as Lab Manager for Microlot Processing at harvest time.

The Archers Lot Archers Lots culminate our co-founders’ creativity and technical acumen to compose truly artisanal specialty coffee experiences for both the discerning and adventurous specialty coffee connoisseurs, in collaboration with our closest producing partners. In this Archers-curated 120-hour anaerobic honey process, the perfectly ripe, hand-harvested, and carefully pre-cleaned cherries were re-sorted on raised beds to ensure uniformity of the ripeness level (visually indicated by color) before they were de-pulped (i.e. skin removed) and then sealed in 50-60 KG plastic barrels with lids having a one-way valve. This was done to aid in maintaining an oxygen-free fermentation phase throughout the pre-determined 120-hour period. After fermentation, the barrels were emptied onto the raised beds, as the de-pulped cherries were evenly spread out in very thin layers, allowing the fermentation juices to sufficiently drain off of them. The specific instruction to maintain very thinly layered cherries throughout the sun-drying phase was deliberate, to avoid extraneous microbial activity as the coffees had already undergone the necessary fermentation in the barrels prior. The target moisture level was achieved after 14 to 18 days. As a result of this process, this cup expresses heightened florality and honeyed sweetness, with a transparent, lively, and refreshing character.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-elto-archers-lot-honey
"Panama - Horizon, Finca Deborah","coffee flower, orange blossom, mandarine, peach, strawberry",375.00,"Description Description Producer: Jamison Savage / Finca Deborah Location: Volcan, Chiriqui, PanamaVariety: Green Tip GeishaProcess: Natural - Yeast InoculationAltitude: 1700-1900 MASLCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Jamison Savage of Finca Deborah, Iris Estate, and Savage Coffees is known throughout the specialty coffee world due to his pioneering methods. Engaged in progressive processing techniques and farming practices respectful of nature, Jamison lets the most favorable, naturally occurring sensory nuances of a coffee shine on the palate. It’s a feat accomplished by few and evidently appreciated worldwide, as national and world coffee competitors frequently choose to showcase his coffees. 2016 saw Finca Deborah in the limelight when Taiwan’s Berg Wu won the World Barista Championship using a Geisha from the estate. Since then, numerous national champions have entrusted Jamison to design coffees for their routines on the world stage. Among them are our very own WBrC representative David Disuanco and France's Charity Cheung. The Finca Deborah story started long before 2016 and far away from Panama though. It was in the early 2000s when Jamison, at the height of his finance career in the US, decided a change was in order. He longed for a freer lifestyle to give himself and his family a chance to spend more time outdoors and to travel. At the same time, he was looking for a real estate asset to fill a gap in his investment portfolio. In our 2022 Producer’s Talk, Jamison shared that they were choosing between Panama and New Zealand. Panama eventually won out for practical reasons and the sheer beauty and promise of the land. Their deliberation and preparation took about five years and culminated in 2008, the year the Savage family uprooted and started anew on foreign soil. They made their new home in the Volcan region of the Chiriqui province, the seat of Panama Geisha cultivation and home to Finca Deborah, Iris Estate, and Savage Coffees. Finca Deborah is Jamison Savage’s foremost terroir-cognizant coffee plantation at 1,700 to 1,900 masl in Volcan, Chiriqui. The farm, which rests beneath a rainforest canopy, is organically cultivated and entirely solar-powered. In those pristine surroundings, the elegant Panama Geisha trees flourish, so cherries simply take in and contain the innate lushness and vibrance of the environment. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Horizon underwent a hybrid process that started with harvesting perfectly ripe Panama Geisha cherries registering 21-24 on the BRIX meter. These cherries were twice sorted and selected before being deposited into hermetically sealed, stainless steel tanks, with a yeast inoculation strain added. The cherries stayed immersed in this yeast bath for more than 100 hours, allowing the yeast to consume a substantial portion of the fruit within the cherries to generate high fruit notes and floral aromatics, that the coffee seeds then absorbed. In the cup, these would be expressed as enhanced aromatics, pleasantly elevated acidity, and a more palpable body. Throughout this yeast-inoculated, extended fermentation phase, the cherries were constantly monitored and cataloged for both PH and temperature levels. The Finca Deborah team complied with strict parameters to ensure the process would only preserve and enhance the meticulously cultivated and harvested Panama Geisha's inherent sensory characteristics, and in no way let them acquire any unwanted notes or ""off"" flavors. After the required time immersed in the yeast bath within the sealed tanks, the cherries were removed and transferred onto shaded, three-tiered raised African beds that Jamison himself designed. Temperatures and humidity were controlled inside the shaded drying areas, also referred to as dry houses, where these metrics were carefully maintained within specific parameters. The cherries were also consistently shifted throughout the day for even drying, to prevent undesired microbial activity from occurring, and to promote the development only of desired flavors. The cherries spent around 12 days on the drying beds before reaching the proper moisture level of approximately 11%. To protect the quality that had painstakingly been created, they were then bagged in Grain-pro and stored under optimal conditions of cool and stable temperatures for a reposo or seasoning process critical in Jamison's stringent end-to-end QC protocol. In reposo, the coffee's moisture content stabilized while allowing it to keep absorbing more flavor from its parchment or shell, before being hulled and further sorted by size, density, and color, and finally shipped to us. About the Panama Geisha Panama Geisha, of which Green Tip Geisha is one variation, is a rare, delicate, and complex variety well-loved for its sweet florality and citrus highlights. Since its debut win at the Best of Panama auction in 2004, it has kept specialty coffee lovers everywhere captivated by its endless possibilities, delicacy, complexity, and clarity of flavors. As such, it is often showcased on coffee competition stages by a great number of coffee champions, and it also continues to fetch the highest prices. While a coffee’s truest intrinsic qualities are still largely believed to be showcased best by traditional washed processing due to the demucilaging, washing, and scrubbing steps removing all traces of fruit from the bean, the expertise of seasoned and passionate producers like Jamison Savage allows them to direct the flavor character of the Panama Geisha towards a seemingly endless diversity of delightfully surprising trajectories. They do this through the purposeful implementation of traditional methods like the natural and honey processes, as well as intentional and innovative processing styles, such as this Natural - Yeast Inoculation process, which add to the complexity of the cup’s character — for example more layers of flavor or better mouthfeel — without compromising its inherent qualities from terroir and variety.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/panama-horizon

Colombia - Aroma Nativo Pink Bourbon,"lemon grass, green apple, ginger ale",110.00,"Description Description Producer: Luis Marcelino / Aroma NativoLocation: Acevedo, HuilaVariety: Pink BourbonProcess: Natural AnaerobicAltitude: 1,600 maslCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Luis Marcelino wholeheartedly diverged from the well-trodden path of a strategic, corporate achiever well-established in a world city to find his place in the world of coffee. The yearning to own his time and spend more of his days nearer to nature came while he was living and working in Paris. His love for drinking specialty coffee and the circumstance of his wife having ties in Colombia led him to explore opportunities for a fresh start toward what he believed to be a more fulfilling life they could build from there. Having been born and raised, and come of age, in the wine-growing highlands of his home country Portugal, he has always had an innate affinity for natural landscapes, a sense of wonder for the bounties of the land, and an inexhaustible curiosity about his part in making the big picture more beautiful. From 2017 to 2019, he spent two years traveling between France and Colombia to learn first-hand about coffee cultivation, processing, and the export/import trade. As he connected with a few farmers and seasoned producers, his interest in coffee genetics and the intricacies of processing flourished too. Taking inspiration from Ninety Plus in Panama, he pitched the idea of venturing into natural and experimental processing to a partner, who was then only producing traditional, washed coffees according to the nationally sanctioned norm. After intentional and thoroughly documented experiments with small batches, he drew up the first non-traditional protocols that formed the foundations of his company, Aroma Nativo, established in 2019. The cherries in this lot are the fruits of the hard work and dedication of a collective of coffee farmers who are part of the Veci Project. They are Jeremías Silva, Miguel Castillo, and Carlos Mario. Aroma Nativo began with a processing hub based in Huila, Colombia, and a trading company headquartered in Paris, France. With the 2022 acquisition of a five-hectare farmland dedicated to cultivating rare coffee varieties that will be processed towards 90+ levels, Luis is boosting his stake in the arena of competition coffees. This comes on the heels of Aroma Nativo lots having been showcased by several coffee champions on their respective national stages — Portugal, Italy, Austria, and Sweden — and also represented in the world arena. About Veci Project In 2022, Luis implemented the Veci Project, having realized the extent to which purposeful processing could contribute to improving coffee quality and enable coffee farmers to enjoy a better quality of life when they get higher returns for their harvests. He chose the name veci, shorthand for the colloquial vecino meaning neighbor, because it reflects the spirit of solidarity among the community of farmers the project seeks to serve. Essentially, the project provides a viable alternative for coffee farmers with commendable agronomic practices to receive advance payments that aid their cash flow and also earn a premium for high-quality cherries suitable for expressing the in-demand flavor profiles sought by Aroma Nativo’s global network of renowned roasters. The Veci Project is also instrumental for Luis to effectuate his passion for sustainably contributing to uplifting the vecis’ lives through education. Since the majority of them have not yet been initiated into the contemporary methods and consequent benefits of specialty coffee, they are still most comfortable with the notion of selling their coffees to conventional processing stations to be washed and marketed primarily as commercial-grade products. To shift their mindset, Luis and his team at origin devote resources to conduct workshops covering a vast range of subjects from cultivation to post-harvest processing. Topics include: identifying coffee varieties, increasing shade cover in their farms, selective picking, and fermenting and drying their own cherries — all with the aim of improving quality and the potential to garner a higher cup score. Conscious of the youth’s declining interest in coffee farming in the blessed terroir of Huila, Veci Project puts a priority on seeking out and speaking to the new generation of coffee farmers and producers. The core of their conversations is that doing a proper job with coffee — from cultivation and harvesting to processing — presents them with better opportunities to thrive at home, where they are, than the seeming attraction of migrating to larger cities, where they might not be as equipped to make it. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The Pink Bourbon is a natural mutation of Bourbon that reportedly originated in Huila, Colombia. Visually, its cherries are distinguished from other varieties by their mesmerizing pink hue. It thrives in high-altitude regions with volcanic soil and benefits from favorable microclimates. Its cultivation requires careful attention. Farmers in the Veci Project meticulously follow cultivation and harvesting best practices such as regular fertilization proper pruning, and selective picking and to ensure ideal growth and yield. They also maintain proper shade management to facilitate the optimal ripening of cherries. The Pink Bourbon exhibits moderate resistance to common coffee ailments and is highly regarded for its outstanding cup quality potential. Typically, when washed, it expresses bright fruit notes along that can be accompanied by subtle floral undertones and hints of caramel. When traditionally natural-processed, its character turns toward more intense fruitiness, that can include notes of ripe berries and even exotic fruits. In this lot, however, by implementing a natural anaerobic processing protocol, Luis was able to direct the Pink Bourbon’s flavor profile toward a refreshingly novel medley of lively aromatics, subtle and crisp acidity, alongside a mildly creamy and spiced sweetness.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/colombia-aroma-nativo-pink-bourbon
Costa Rica - El Jardin Geisha,"floral, red grapes, honey, caramelized dates",125.00,"Description Description Producer: Café Rivense del Chirripó / Ureña Rojas FamilyLocation: Chirripó Variety: Geisha Process: Black HoneyAltitude: 1,500 – 1,700 maslCrop Year: 2022 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer The pioneering Ureña Rojas family of Café Rivense del Chirripó, led by Régulo Ureña and Isabel Rojas, broke away from the country's commercially driven mega-mill processing model in the early 2000s when they built the first micro-mill in the Upper Buenavista Catchment in the Brunca region of southern Costa Rica. The move was a definite game-changer that gave them control over quality and the capacity to be creative to experiment and maximize the flavor potential of the coffees grown on their farm and their neighbors'. Brunca is one of the eight coffee-growing regions identified by the country's national coffee institute, ICAFE. It is dubbed the last frontier in the ICAFE publication Cafe de Costa Rica: Spirit of a Nation because it is the most remote of all the eight. Within it, the Chirripó micro-region has been gaining renown as a specialty coffee origin due to its terroir. Located between the country's two highest mountains, Cerro de la Muerte (3.491m.) and Cerro Chirripó (3.820m.), coffee farms in this area sit at high altitudes from 1300 to 2000 masl and benefit from the rich soils and biodiverse natural environment. All of these contribute to the unique microclimates that allow coffee trees to grow well and produce healthy cherries that capture the myriad flavors of the land. The remarkable quality of Chirripó coffee had been recognized at the Cup of Excellence, with a Café Rivense honey-processed Caturra ranking 5th in the 2019 competition. This recognition encouraged an increase in land planted with coffee and the cultivation of different varieties in the Chirripó micro-region, which is projected to continue for years ahead. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process Geisha is an Ethiopian forest coffee variety that found its way to Costa Rica through CATIE or the Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza. It is known for displaying complexity, distinct florality, and delicate citrus notes in the cup. The Ureña Rojas family's focus on traceability through micro-lots enables innovation in post-harvest processing at Café Rivense. The micro-lot system allows them to identify and associate which particular varieties, such as Catuai, grown in which specific microclimates across the farm, express their best qualities when processed in a certain way. Since micro-lot information is shared when marketing their coffees, consumer feedback can be tied back to the micro-lot and support Café Rivense in learning about the market's preferences and modifying aspects of their production accordingly. In this micro-lot, the cherries were selectively hand-picked at the peak of ripeness and processed without the use of water, whether in transit or during pulping. The mucilage was kept full and clean throughout the sun-drying phase. Using a black honey process, Café Rivense amplified this Geisha micro-lot's floral aromatics and intensified its sweetness, balanced with a light and lively acidity.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/costa-rica-el-jardin-geisha

Panama - Janson Lot 134 Geisha,"peach, jasmine, sugarcane, papaya",255.00,"Description Description Producer: Janson CoffeeLocation: Los Alpes, Tizingal Variety: Green Tip GeishaProcess: Natural, 48hrs FermentationAltitude: 1,700 maslCrop Year: 2023 The Farm and Producer The Farm and Producer Three generations of Jansons run the operations of Janson Coffee today. Kai and Jannette Janson, both from the second generation and Miguel, Janette’s son, are at the forefront. Their coffees have been awarded and auctioned several times at the Best of Panama, and are often featured by coffee champions on the world stage. 2023 has so far been a hallmark year for @kaijanson, @jannettejanson, and the rest of the Janson coffee family as they were part of that dream team who took home the top trophy at the 2023 World Barista Championship, with a Janson Geisha at the core of the winning routine, as well as podium finishers at the 2023 World Brewers Cup. At the Best of Panama 2023, Janson Geisha Natural ranked 3rd, while Geisha Washed placed 5th. Their family’s work in coffee began in the mid-1980s when the first generation realized their land’s potential for coffee cultivation after receiving advice from agricultural engineers. And it was in 1990 that Janson Coffee was officially established by Michael, Carl, Ricardo†, and Peter Janson. They were inspired by their father’s dedication to hard work, quality, and love for their land. Since the company’s founding, their vision has been to produce high-quality specialty coffee consumed and enjoyed in Panama and abroad. Their father was Carl Axel Janson, a Swedish immigrant who acquired and established the original Janson hacienda, a cattle farm, in 1941. As a family enterprise, they continue to be driven by the passion to produce excellent coffees while preserving their land and improving the quality of life of their collaborators and their respective families. Two coffee plantations, spanning 100 hectares combined, comprise Janson Coffee. Both are located on the Talamanca Mountain Range, on the inclines of the Tizingal and Baru volcanoes. Different varieties are cultivated on them — Catuai, Caturra, Pacamara, and Panama Geisha. Hacienda las Lagunas is in Tierras Altas, the High Lands District, in Volcan. Its name comes from the wetlands and lagoons in the vicinity. Located west of the Barú Volcano, Hacienda las Lagunas is rich in volcanic soil and has access to natural springs. Areas of natural reserve surround the different lots in the coffee farm and act as natural barriers. They also serve as essential habitats for a diversity of birds and wildlife. Meanwhile, Los Alpes, named after the Swiss Alps sits on the slopes of the Tizingal volcano, amid the Talamanca Mountain range in the westernmost part of Panama, northwest of the Barú Volcano and adjacent to the La Amistad International Park, which is a natural reserve and UNESCO World Heritage Site. This park crosses the Panamanian border into Costa Rica and shelters rich biodiversity, including the famous Quetzal bird. Raising the Energy Around Coffee At our February 2023 Producer’s Talk, when Kai shared his thoughts on how he sees specialty coffee evolving, we gained insight into the impetus for the innovations at Janson Coffee that result in the fascinating flavor profiles in our cup. What he said also lightly touched on the consumer's role in shaping the future of specialty coffee. He told us, ""It's an amazing ride — to see coffee grow and the energy around coffee… Our intention is, how do you create a coffee that is so fruity that you know it's a natural, and so powerful you know it's anaerobic, and so clean and gorgeous that it's like a classic washed — all in one cup, and at different points in the cup…if you're paying attention, you'll see that."" He also mentioned that brewing plays a large part in upholding quality. When we asked what's on the horizon for Janson Coffee, Kai shared that their goal is to keep raising the energy around coffee. We took this to mean: continuing to chase excellence in coffee quality and keeping everyone excited about it by creating genuine relationships and fun shared experiences with the coffee people they encounter. The Coffee and The Process The Coffee and The Process The legendary Geisha variety is acclaimed for its sweet florality and bright overtones. Since its debut win at the Best of Panama auction in 2004, it has kept specialty coffee lovers everywhere captivated by its endless possibilities, delicacy, complexity, and clarity of flavors. As such, it is often showcased on coffee competition stages by a great number of coffee champions, and it also continues to fetch the highest prices. Throughout their 30+ year history, the Jansons have relied on the experience of their founders while remaining attentive to every step and fine-tuning areas of production, from cultivation to processing, that will allow them to produce increasingly more delicious coffees. To begin with, they maintain the balance of nutrients in the soil by preserving the endemic flora in their farms, which serve as natural barriers and obviate the need for pesticides or herbicides. Pickers are trained to select and hand-collect only the properly ripe cherries at harvest, and to further re-assess the cherries in their baskets and remove any that do not conform. These are then carefully placed in plastic crates, and no longer in sacks, to be sent for processing. This change was done to remove the risk of the cherries being compressed, and losing juices and sugars beneficial to flavor development, while in transit to the beneficio or plant . Upon reaching the plant, the cherries are passed through a mechanical siphon to separate the denser cherries from the rest before going into fermentation. This is done since the highest potential for the best flavors rests within the healthiest cherries, typically indicated by a higher density. Alpes Panama Geisha Lot 134 underwent 48 hours of natural fermentation and 12 days of sun-drying on the patio. To dry on the patio, the coffee is laid out under the sun in the daytime and shifted periodically to encourage even drying. Come the afternoon, the coffee is collected and sheltered in a warehouse, where it is protected from excessive moisture and able to rest. This is in order to maximize the absorption of sugar and flavors from the pulp into the bean until the drying phase is completed. This resulted in a cup character that is juicy yet delicate, with a complexity evident in its simultaneously syrupy and bright, and rounded and crisp qualities.",https://archerscoffee.com//collections/coffee/products/panama-janson-lot-134-geisha
