Colombia | La Cereza | Pink Bourbon | Washed | Filter | 250g,"Tasting Notes
Green apple, lime, & passionfruit",$50.00,"Region: San Agustin, Huila
Elevation: 2250 masl
About: Established in 2016, La Cereza (The Cherry) is a community wet mill, research centre, and eco-farm located in the lush green hills above San Agustin, Huila. From here, Felipe Ospina processes coffees from surrounding farms, runs training courses and carries out experiments to make coffee tastier and more sustainable. While the wet mill and research centre are the shared brain of Felipe’s operation, the farm at La Cereza is the beating heart. From tiny seedlings to ripe cherry, it’s ground zero for all of Felipe’s endeavours.  This lot was picked on the edge of over-ripeness and processed as a traditional washed coffee. Pink Bourbon is a rare variety and is thought to be a natural hybrid of Yellow and Red Bourbon. This coffee is incredibly sweet and complex, the high glucose content of Pink Bourbon gives it a silky mouthfeel.",https://www.proudmarycoffee.com.au//collections/coffee/products/colombia-la-cereza-pink-bourbon-washed-filter-250g
Brazil | Serra das Tres Barras | Yellow Bourbon | Pulped Natural | Espresso | 250g,"Tasting Notes
Dried apricot, raw sugar, & vanilla",$26.00,"Region: Carmo de Minas, Minas Gerais 
Relationship: Since 2011
Altitude: 1100-1450 masl 
The Junqueira family has cultivated coffee at Serra das Tres Barras for eight generations. Leading the way is Jose Wagner Ribeiro Junqueira, with his wife, Margarida, and his sons Kleber, Ralph, and Herbert. Their farm sits at an elevation of 1,100 to 1,450 meters above sea level, and they focus on producing high-quality micro-lots. Serra das Tres Barras stands out from other Brazilian farms due to its unique approach. In Brazil, labour costs are high, making it challenging for large farms to hire enough workers for harvesting. Consequently, many farms rely on machines for the task. However, at Serra das Tres Barras, workers are employed to meticulously hand-pick the cherries. In 2011, Nolan, the founder of Proud Mary, first visited Jose Wagner. Since then, Proud Mary has formed a lasting partnership with him. Jose's coffee transformed Nolan's perception of Brazilian coffee, and in 2012, he purchased the entire Cup of Excellence #4, Jose's coffee, and sold it as the house espresso to spread the message of how unique Brazilian coffees can be. Year after year, Jose's coffee continues to impress, and this year is no exception.",https://www.proudmarycoffee.com.au//collections/coffee/products/brazil-serra-das-tres-barras-yellow-bourbon-pulped-natural-espresso-250g

Elevation: 1500-1550 masl
About: Proud Mary's connection to the Santa Barbara region of Honduras began all the way back in 2012 when we were introduced to a small group of producers situated around the town of Peña Blanca, close to the shores of the stunning Lake Yojoa. More than a decade later, that group of producers has grown in number, and our relationships have deepened. Nahun was one of the first producers we ever started working with. Back then, he grew traditional varieties and only used the washed method. Today, he is a processing master and has become a leader in his community by sharing all the techniques he has learnt. The coffee quality produced in the Las Flores community has improved. Nahun has placed in the Cup of Excellence competition three times, each was with some variation of his Parainema. His natural anaerobic process ranked 4th in 2022, and his was the only non-Geisha in the top seven places!

Elevation: 1500-1650 masl
About: In 2018, we noticed that our Honduran producers were doing so well that their production was increasing quicker than we could sell. Enter… Chicos Buenos (Good Guys). Chicos Buenos is a community blend that we created with our producers in Santa Barbara so we could take more of their coffee. Because this coffee is a blend of several different lots, it scores higher than any of the individual components. It truly is more than the sum of its parts. Chicos Buenos brings the fruit to our Angel Wings blend but also makes a great stand-alone brew. For the 2022 harvest, the producers who contributed to this blend are Balbina Sabillon, Nahun Fernandez, Ovidio Gomez, & Manuel Vallecillo.",https://www.proudmarycoffee.com.au//collections/coffee/products/honduras-chicos-buenos-mixed-washed-filter-250g-2

Honduras | Balbina Sabillon | Parainema | Honey | Espresso | 250g,"Tasting Notes
Caramel, green apple, & honey",$29.00,"Region: Las Flores, Santa Barbara
Elevation: 1300 masl
About: In 2018, Balbina became the first female producer we started working with in Honduras. Her family have been producing coffee in Santa Barbara for three generations, and today she works on her modest farm with her two children. Balbina’s farm is planted exclusively with Parainema (and a little bit of Geisha) because it thrives a low to medium altitudes. There's also something different about Balbina’s land that makes her Parainema a bit sweeter and rounder than the surrounding areas. Balbina loves spending time in her garden when she's not tending to her farm. She is a succulent enthusiast and loves growing unusual and interesting plants. A few years ago, she began experimenting with honey and natural processes on her Parainema. When processed as a honey, this coffee is extra sweet with caramel, honey, and green apple notes.",https://www.proudmarycoffee.com.au//collections/coffee/products/honduras-balbina-sabillon-parainema-honey-espresso-250g

Apricot jam, strawberry, honey, & tropical",$71.00,"About: Eugene Altieri (Don Gene) started growing coffee in Boquete over 20 years ago. With no prior experience in the coffee industry but a keen business mind, Don Gene saw the potential for a thriving family business. The family's two farms, Alto Lino and Callejón Seco are planted with Caturra, Catuai, Typica, and Geisha. Altieri's Geisha has a storied lineage with exceptional quality; Don Gene purchased Geisha seeds from the Peterson family of Hacienda La Esmeralda who reintroduced Geisha to the world in 2004, winning the Best of Panama competition. After Don Gene's retirement five years ago, the family business is now run by his children, Anna Lynn and Francisco, and farm manager Roger Pitti. All the Altieri family’s Geisha is planted at Callejón Seco, just to the Southeast of the Volcán Barú National Park, and the different tablons on the farm are named after Eugene’s grandchildren. This Geisha was processed using a special dry fermentation (DFS) method, where the coffee is partially dried on raised beds before undergoing an anaerobic fermentation, followed by a final drying stage in a dark temperature-controlled room.",https://www.proudmarycoffee.com.au//collections/coffee/products/panama-altieri-estate-ale-geisha-dfs-natural-filter-100g

Panama | Finca Momoto | Laurina | Natural | Filter | 100g,"Tasting Notes
Milk chocolate, passionfruit, & juicy",$45.00,"About: If you’re looking for a delicious coffee experience, without the overstimulating buzz of that comes with lots of caffeine, then we’re got the coffee for you. Laurina (aka Bourbon Pointu) is a natural mutation of the Bourbon variety and has half the caffeine of most Arabica varieties. This is the first time we’ve purchased Laurina, and it’s fitting that it’s from one of our longest producer relationships. Founded in 2015 by Aliss Hartmann, Finca Momoto is a new branch on the storied Hartmann family tree. Aliss and her four siblings grew up at Finca Hartmann, playing amongst the coffee trees and climbing on bags of stored parchment at the mill, and as adults, the Hartmann children each took roles at Finca Hartmann. As her own children, Giuliana and Giuseppe grew up, she wanted them to have a similar childhood experience, and purchased Finca Momoto to teach them the value of the land, respect for nature, and to share with them the same love and passion for coffee that her parents shared with her. This is the best way to drink coffee without getting high.",https://www.proudmarycoffee.com.au//collections/coffee/products/panama-finca-momoto-laurina-natural-filter-100g
Colombia | Popayan Reserve | Caturra & Castillo | Espresso | Washed Decaf,"Tasting Notes
Caramelised fig, raw sugar, & brown spice",$23.00,"Region: Popayan
Such a great decaf, this will take you on a great coffee journey and deliver a clean and vibrant cup that will leave you wanting more. No fear of missing out here, this decaf sure is one quality coffee!The Popayan Reserve is a regional lot from the department of Cauca, Colombia. This region was chosen as it is conducive to producing coffees with good body and sweetness. Currently 67 select farms contribute to this regional lot and it provides employment for over 400 people.
This coffee is decaffeinated using ethyl acetate (derivative from sugar-cane). It selectively removes the caffeine from the coffee while leaving all the other tasty flavour compounds. Ethyl acetate occurs in ripening fruit and is a highly volatile compound meaning that none of it remains after the coffee has been roasted.",https://www.proudmarycoffee.com.au//collections/coffee/products/colombia-popayan-reserve-caturra-castillo-espresso-decaf
