Iris is one of the highest altitude farms in Panama with production stretching up past 2100 m.a.s.l. This altitude is a double edged sword as it makes it difficult to grow Geisha but also produces outstanding cup profiles. Jamison uses proprietary processing techniques, including the infamous Carbonic Maceration, to produce flavour profiles that are unique and delicious. You can expect clean, delicate fruit forward cup profiles from Iris Estate. 
Symbiosis is the classic anaerobic natural process employed by Jamison Savage. Cherries are paced in sealed tanks and left to ferment in a low oxygen environment, with no external gas is added to the tank. Cherries are then removed from the tanks, washed and dried for around 25 days. Symbiosis is a little funkier and bolder than the CM and other experimental coffees from Jamison. Expect a fruit forward cup with notes of red fruit, purple fruit and a brown sugar-like sweetness.",https://threecoffee.com/products/panama-iris-estate-geisha-symbiosis-anaerobic-natural
